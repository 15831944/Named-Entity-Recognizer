theu800 shocking step ofu800 claiming that this traditional account hasu800 things inu800 reverse with reason language andu800 rationally organized communities allu800 having developed over au800 long

areu800 relevant tou800 political andu800 ethical thought because according tou800 theu800 aristotelian theory au800 best wayu800 ofu800 living together exists independently ofu800 historical circumstances. according tou800 rousseau weu800 should even doubt that reason language andu800 politics areu800 au800 good thing asu800 opposed tou800 being simply theu800 best option given theu800 particular course ofu800 events that lead tou800 today. rousseau rousseau'su800 theory that human nature isu800 malleable rather than fixed isu800 often taken tou800 imply foru800 example byu800 karl
