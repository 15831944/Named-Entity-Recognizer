nonu800-compact surfaces with infinite genus. proof proof proof theu800 classification ofu800 closed surfaces hasu800 been known since theu800 1860s harv francis weeks 1999 andu800 today au800 number ofu800 proofs exist. topological andu800 combinatorial proofs inu800 general rely onu800 theu800 difficult result that every compact 2u800-manifold isu800 homeomorphic tou800 au800 simplicial complex which isu800 ofu800 interest inu800 itsu800 ownu800 right. theu800 most common proof ofu800 theu800 classification isu800 harv seifert threlfall 1934 which brings every triangulated surface tou800 au800 standard form. au800 simplified proof which avoids au800 standard form wasu800 discovered byu800 john hu800. conway circa 1992 which heu800 called theu800 zero irrelevancy proof oru800 zipu800 proof andu800 isu800 presented inu800 harv francis weeks 1999 . au800 geometric proof which yields au800 stronger geometric result isu800 theu800 uniformization theorem . this wasu800 originally proven only foru800 riemann surfaces inu800 theu800 1880s andu800 1900s byu800 felix klein paul koebe andu800 henri poincaru8c3a9 . surfaces inu800 geometry surfaces inu800 geometry surfaces inu800 geometry main differential geometry ofu800 surfaces polyhedra such asu800 theu800 boundary ofu800 au800 cube areu800 among theu800 first surfaces encountered inu800 geometry. itu800 isu800 also possible tou800 define  smooth surfaces  inu800 which each point hasu800 au800 neighborhood diffeomorphism diffeomorphic tou800 some open setu800 inu800  eu800 u8c2b2. this elaboration allows calculus tou800 beu800 applied tou800 surfaces tou800 prove many results. twou800 smooth surfaces areu800 diffeomorphic ifu800 andu800 only ifu800 they areu800 homeomorphic. theu800 analogous result does notu800 hold foru800 higher-dimensional manifolds. thus closed surface surfaces areu800 classified upu800 tou800 diffeomorphism byu800 their euler characteristic andu800 orientability. smooth surfaces equipped with riemannian metric metrics areu800 ofu800 fundational importance inu800 differential geometry . au800 riemannian metric endows au800 surface with notions ofu800 geodesic distance angle

inu800 that itu800 isu800 notu800 preserved byu800 general diffeomorphisms ofu800 theu800 surface. however theu800 famous gauss-bonnet theorem foru800 closed surfaces states that theu800 integral

exemplifies theu800 deep relationship between theu800 geometry andu800 topology ofu800 surfaces andu800 tou800 au800 lesser extent higher-dimensional manifolds . another wayu800 inu800 which surfaces
