characteristics tou800 this dayu800 wordperfect wordperfect'su800 three major characteristics that have differentiated itu800 from other market-leading word processors areu800 itsu800 streaming code architecture itsu800 reveal codes feature andu800 itsu800 unusually user-friendly macro scripting language perfectscript. theu800 ease ofu800 useu800 ofu800 tools like 'merge' combine form documents with data from anyu800 data source 'print asu800 booklet' andu800 tables with spreadsheet capabilities andu800 possibility tou800 generate graphs areu800 also notable. theu800 concept ofu800 theu800 wordperfect document format allows continuous extending ofu800 functionality without jeopardizing backward andu800 forward compatibility. despite theu800 fact that theu800 newer version isu800 extremely rich inu800 functionality wordperfect x5u800 documents areu800 fully compatible with wordperfect 6u800u82e0au800 documents inu800 both directions. theu800 older program simply ignores theu800 'unknown' property while rendering theu800 known elements ofu800 theu800 document. wordperfect users were never forced tou800 upgrade foru800 compatibility reasons foru800 more than twou800 decades. streaming code architecture streaming code architecture streaming code architecture au800 keyu800 tou800 wordperfect wordperfect'su800 design isu800 itsu800 streaming code architecture that parallels theu800 formatting features ofu800 html andu800 cascading style sheets . documents areu800 created much theu800 same wayu800 that rawu800 html pages areu800 written with text interspersed byu800 tags called codes that trigger treatment ofu800 data until au800 corresponding closing tagu800 isu800 encountered atu800 which point theu800 settings active tou800 theu800 point ofu800 theu800 opening tagu800 resume control. asu800 with html tags canu800 beu800 nested. some data structures areu800 treated asu800 objects within theu800 stream asu800 with html html'su800 treatment ofu800 graphic images eu800u82egu800. footnotes andu800 styles butu800 theu800 bulk ofu800 au800 wordperfect document document'su800 data andu800 formatting codes appear asu800 au800 single continuous stream. au800 difference between html tags andu800 wordperfect codes isu800 that html codes canu800 allu800 beu800 expressed asu800 au800 string ofu800 plain text characters delimited byu800 greater-than andu800 less-than characters eu800u82egu800. &ltu800;bold&gtu800;text&ltu800; bold&gtu800; whereas wordperfect formatting codes consist ofu800 hexadecimal values. styles andu800 style libraries styles andu800 style libraries styles andu800 style libraries theu800 addition ofu800 styles andu800 style libraries inu800 wpu800 5u800u82e0u800 provided greatly increased power andu800 flexibility inu800 formatting documents while maintaining theu800 streaming-code architecture ofu800 earlier versions. prior tou800 that wordperfect wordperfect'su800 only useu800 ofu800 styles au800 particular type ofu800 programming object wasu800 theu800 opening style which contained theu800 default settings foru800 au800 document. after theu800 purchase ofu800 theu800 desktop publishing program corel ventura ventura corel enhanced theu800 wordperfect styles editor andu800 styles behavior with theu800 majority ofu800 ventura ventura'su800 capabilities. this improved theu800 usability andu800 performance ofu800 graphic elements like text boxes document styles footer andu800 header styles. since wordperfect hasu800 been enriched with properties from coreldraw graphics suite graphic styles areu800 editable. theu800 graphics styles editor enables customizing theu800 appearance ofu800 boxes borders lines andu800 fills andu800 store theu800 customized design foru800 reuse. theu800 possibilities include patterns andu800 color gradients foru800 fills; corner endpoint penu800-type andu800 thickness foru800 lines. boxu800 styles canu800 beu800 used asu800 container style including au800 border lines fill text andu800 caption; each with itsu800 separate style. au800 text boxu800 style shows that wordperfect cascades itsu800 styles. around theu800 same time corel included wordperfect with itsu800 full functionality inu800 coreldraw graphics suite asu800 theu800 text editor. reveal codes reveal codes reveal codes file corel wordperfect x3u800 reveal codes screenshotu82epngu800 thumb right theu800  reveal codes  feature inu800 corel wordperfect x3u800 theu800 reveal codes feature isu800 au800 second editing screen that canu800 beu800 toggled open andu800 closed atu800 theu800 bottom ofu800 theu800 main editing screen. text isu800 displayed inu800 reveal codes interspersed with tags andu800 theu800 occasional objects with theu800 tags andu800 objects represented byu800 named tokens. theu800 scheme makes itu800 faru800 easier tou800 untangle coding messes than with styles-based word processors andu800 object tokens canu800 beu800 clicked with au800 pointing device tou800 directly open theu800 configuration editor foru800 theu800 particular object type eu800u82egu800. clicking onu800 au800 style token brings upu800 theu800 style editor with theu800 particular style type displayed. because ofu800 their style dependencies efforts tou800 create theu800 equivalent ofu800 reveal codes inu800 other word processors have produced dissimilar results. note that wordperfect hadu800 this feature already inu800 itsu800 dosu800 incarnations itu800 could beu800 brought forward byu800 pressing theu800 keys altu800 keyu800 altu800 andu800 function keyu800 f3u800 together. macro languages macro languages macro languages wordperfect foru800 dosu800 wasu800 notable foru800 itsu800 altu800 -keystroke macro facility which wasu800 expanded with theu800 addition ofu800 macro libraries inu800 wpu800 5u800u82e0u800 that also allowed foru800 ctrl-keystroke macros andu800 remapping ofu800 anyu800 keyu800 asu800 au800 macro. this enabled anyu800 sequence ofu800 keystrokes tou800 beu800 recorded saved edited andu800 recalled. macros could examine system data make decisions beu800 chained together andu800 operate recursively until au800 defined 'stop' condition wasu800 metu800. this capability provided anu800 amazingly powerful wayu800 tou800 rearrange data andu800 formatting codes within au800 document where theu800 same sequence ofu800 actions needed tou800 beu800 performed repetitively eu800u82egu800. foru800 tabular data. macros canu800 also beu800 edited using wordperfect program editor. this facility however could notu800 beu800 ported easily tou800 theu800 subsequent windows versions. au800 newu800 andu800 even more powerful interpreted token-based macro recording andu800 scripting language wasu800 introduced foru800 both dosu800 andu800 windows 6u800u82e0u800 versions andu800 that became theu800 basis ofu800 theu800 language named perfectscript inu800 later versions. perfectscript hasu800 remained theu800 mainstay scripting language foru800 wordperfect users ever since. perfectscript wasu800 designed specifically tou800 beu800 user-friendly thus avoiding faru800 less user-friendly methods ofu800 scripting languages implemented onu800 other word processing programs that require education inu800 advanced programming concepts such asu800 object oriented programming inu800 order tou800 produce useful yetu800 sophisticated andu800 powerful macros. anu800 important property ofu800 wordperfect macros isu800 that they areu800 notu800 embedded inu800 au800 document. asu800 au800 result wordperfect isu800 notu800 prone tou800 macro virus computing macro viruses oru800 malware unlike msu800 word. despite theu800 term macro theu800 language hasu800 hundreds ofu800 commands andu800 functions andu800 inu800 fact creates full-fledged programs resident onu800 andu800 executed onu800 theu800 user user'su800 computer. inu800 wpdos 6u800 theu800 source code isu800 generated using theu800 same interface used tou800 edit documents. au800 wordperfect macro canu800 create oru800 modify au800 document oru800 perform tasks such asu800 displaying results ofu800 au800 calculation such asu800 taking au800 date input adding au800 specific number ofu800 days andu800 displaying theu800 newu800 date inu800 au800 dialog boxu800. documents created oru800 edited byu800 au800 wordperfect macro areu800 nou800 different from those produced byu800 manual input; theu800 macros simply improve efficiency oru800 automate repetitive tasks andu800 also enabled creating content-rich document types which would hardly beu800 feasible manually. what makes theu800 perfectscript macro language especially versatile isu800 itsu800 ability tou800 deploy every function that exists inu800 theu800 entire office suite; nou800 matter ifu800 that function wasu800 designed foru800 wordperfect quattro prou800 oru800 presentations. theu800 macro development wizard presents andu800 explains allu800
