platforms software canu800 beu800 grouped into au800 fewu800 broad categories system software isu800 computer software designed tou800 operate theu800 computer hardware tou800 provide basic functionality andu800 tou800 provide au800 platform foru800 running application software application software. system software includes device driver drivers operating system systems server computing servers software utility utilities andu800 window system systems. system software also includes theu800 booting boot firmware which loads oru800 inu800 some cases constitutes theu800 operating system. firmware isu800 software that hasu800 been permanently stored inu800 hardware specifically inu800 nonu800-volatile memory . thus itu800 hasu800 qualities ofu800 both software andu800 hardware butu800 itu800 isu800 still software. application software andu800 script computer programming scripts were historically defined asu800 allu800 theu800 software that uses theu800 computer system tou800 perform useful work oru800 video game entertainment functions beyond theu800 basic operation ofu800 theu800 computer itself. however inu800 practice theu800 distinction between system software andu800 application software isu800 often blurred dueu800 tou800 bundling ofu800 useful applications with theu800 operating system. application software includes desktop applications such asu800 webu800 browser webu800 browsers andu800 microsoft office asu800 well asu800 smartphone andu800 tablet computer tablet applications called mobile appu800 apps . javascript scripts areu800 pieces ofu800 software traditionally embedded inu800 webu800 pages that areu800 runu800 directly inside theu800 webu800 browser when au800 webu800 page isu800 loaded without theu800 need foru800 au800 webu800 browser plugin. software written inu800 other programming languages canu800 also beu800 runu800 within theu800 webu800 browser ifu800 theu800 software isu800 either translated into javascript oru800 ifu800 au800 webu800 browser plugin that supports that language isu800 installed; theu800 most common example ofu800 theu800 latter isu800 actionscript scripts which areu800 supported byu800 theu800 adobe flash plugin. webu800 applications usually runu800 onu800 theu800 webu800 server andu800 output dynamically-generated webu800 pages tou800 webu800 browsers using eu800u82egu800. phpu800 java

extensions areu800 software that extends oru800 modifies theu800 functionality ofu800 another piece ofu800 software andu800 require that software beu800 used inu800 order tou800 function; embedded software resides asu800 firmware within embedded systems devices dedicated tou800 au800 single useu800 oru800 au800 fewu800 uses such asu800 cars andu800 televisions although some embedded devices such asu800 wireless chipsets canu800  themselves  beu800 part ofu800 anu800 ordinary nonu800-embedded computer system such asu800 au800 pcu800 oru800 smartphone . inu800 theu800 embedded system context there isu800 sometimes nou800 clear distinction between theu800 system software andu800 theu800 application software. however some embedded systems runu800 embedded operating systems andu800 these systems dou800 retain theu800 distinction between system software andu800 application software although typically there will only beu800 oneu800 fixed application which isu800 always ranu800 . microcode isu800 au800 special relatively obscure type ofu800 embedded software which tells theu800 processor  itself  howu800 tou800 execute machine code sou800 itu800 isu800 actually au800 lower level than machine code. itu800 isu800 typically proprietary tou800 theu800 processor manufacturer andu800 anyu800 necessary correctional microcode software updates areu800 supplied byu800 them tou800 users which isu800 much cheaper than shipping replacement processor hardware . thus anu800 ordinary programmer would notu800 expect tou800 ever have tou800 deal with itu800. programming tools programming tools programming tools main programming tool programming tools areu800 software inu800 theu800 form ofu800 programs oru800 applications that software developers also known asu800

implementation each ofu800 which consists ofu800 itsu800 ownu800 setu800 ofu800 programming tools. these tools mayu800 beu800 relatively self-contained programs such asu800 compiler compilers debugger debuggers interpreter computing interpreters linker computing linkers andu800 text editor editors that canu800 beu800 combined together tou800 accomplish au800 task much asu800 oneu800 might useu800

ofu800 such self-contained tools. anu800 ideu800 mayu800 dou800 this either byu800 invoking theu800 relevant individual tools onu800 behalf ofu800 theu800 programmer oru800 byu800 reimplementing their functionality inu800 au800 newu800 wayu800. almost allu800 programming language implementations au800 notable exception being smalltalk provide theu800 option ofu800 using individual tools rather than anu800 ideu800 because some programmers prefer notu800 tou800 useu800 ides foru800 various reasons andu800 ides usually take longer tou800 beu800 developed tou800 anu800 acceptable standard than individual tools - indeed initially newu800 programming languages which areu800 created every year would notu800 typically have ides available foru800 them. software topics software topics software

opposed tou800 embedded system systems analog computer computers andu800 supercomputer supercomputers usually seeu800 three layers ofu800 software performing au800 variety ofu800 tasks platform application andu800 user software. platform software platform computing platform includes theu800 firmware device driver drivers anu800 operating system andu800 typically au800 graphical user interface which inu800 total allow au800 user tou800 interact with theu800 computer andu800 itsu800 peripheral peripherals associated equipment . platform software often comes bundled with theu800 computer. onu800 au800 personal computer pcu800 youu800 will usually have theu800 ability tou800 change theu800 platform software. application software application software oru800 applications areu800 what most people think ofu800 when they think ofu800 software. typical examples include office suites andu800 video games. application software isu800 often purchased separately from computer hardware. sometimes applications areu800 bundled with theu800 computer butu800 that does notu800 change theu800 fact that they runu800 asu800 independent applications. applications areu800 usually independent programs from theu800 operating system though they areu800 often tailored foru800 specific platforms. most users think ofu800 compilers databases andu800 other system software asu800 applications. user-written software endu800-user development tailors systems tou800 meet users specific needs. user software include spreadsheet templates andu800 word processor templates. even email filters areu800 au800 kind ofu800 user software. users create this software themselves andu800 often overlook howu800 important itu800 isu800. depending onu800 howu800 competently theu800 user-written software hasu800 been integrated into default application packages many users mayu800 notu800 beu800 aware ofu800 theu800 distinction between theu800 original packages andu800 what hasu800 been added byu800 cou800-workers. execution execution execution main execution computing computer software hasu800 tou800 beu800 loaded into theu800 computer storage computer computer'su800 storage such asu800 theu800 hard drive oru800 computer memory memory . once theu800 software hasu800 loaded theu800 computer isu800 able tou800  execute  theu800 software. this involves passing instruction computer science instructions from theu800 application software through theu800 system software tou800 theu800 hardware which ultimately receives theu800 instruction asu800 machine language machine code . each instruction causes theu800 computer tou800 carry outu800 anu800 operation&nbsp;u8e28093 moving data computing data carrying outu800 au800 computation oru800 altering theu800 control flow ofu800 instructions. data movement isu800 typically from oneu800 place inu800 memory tou800 another. sometimes itu800 involves moving data between memory andu800 registers which enable high-speed data access inu800 theu800 cpuu800. moving data especially large amounts ofu800 itu800 canu800 beu800 costly. sou800 this isu800 sometimes avoided byu800 using pointers tou800 data instead. computations include simple operations such asu800 incrementing theu800 value ofu800 au800 variable data element. more complex computations mayu800 involve many operations andu800 data elements together. -- this section isu800 simply tou800 long foru800 this article andu800 needs tou800 beu800 compressed into theu800 intro above oru800 moved tou800 theu800 article itself .... instructions mayu800 beu800 performed sequentially conditionally oru800 iteratively. sequential instructions areu800 those operations that areu800 performed oneu800 after another. conditional instructions areu800 performed such that different sets ofu800 instructions execute depending onu800 theu800 value su800 ofu800 some data. inu800 some languages this isu800 known asu800 anu800 ifu800 statement. iterative instructions areu800 performed repetitively andu800 mayu800 depend onu800 some data value. this isu800 sometimes called au800 loop. often oneu800 instruction mayu800 call another setu800 ofu800 instructions that areu800 defined inu800 some other program oru800 module programming module . when more than oneu800 computer processor isu800 used instructions mayu800 beu800 executed simultaneously. au800 simple example ofu800 theu800 wayu800 software operates isu800 what happens when au800 user selects anu800 entry such asu800 copy from au800 menu. inu800 this case au800 conditional instruction isu800 executed tou800 copy text from data inu800 au800 'document' area residing inu800 memory perhaps tou800 anu800 intermediate storage area known asu800 au800 'clipboard' data area. ifu800 au800 different menu

oru800 another document inu800 memory. depending onu800 theu800 application even theu800 example above could become complicated. theu800 field ofu800 software engineering endeavors tou800 manage theu800 complexity ofu800 howu800 software operates. this isu800 especially true foru800 software that operates inu800 theu800 context ofu800 au800 large oru800 powerful computer system . currently almost theu800 only limitations onu800 theu800 useu800 ofu800 computer software inu800 applications isu800 theu800 ingenuity ofu800 theu800 designer programmer. consequently large areas ofu800 activities such asu800 playing grand master level chess formerly assumed tou800 beu800 incapable ofu800 software simulation areu800 nowu800 routinely programmed. theu800 only area that hasu800 sou800

major software companies such asu800 microsoft novell andu800 sunu800 microsystems have their ownu800 software testing departments with theu800 specific goal ofu800 just testing. software canu800 beu800 tested through unit testing regression testing andu800 other methods which areu800 done manually oru800 most commonly automatically since theu800 amount ofu800 code tou800 beu800 tested canu800 beu800 quite large. foru800 instance nasa hasu800 extremely rigorous software testing procedures foru800 many operating systems andu800 communication functions. many nasa based operations interact
