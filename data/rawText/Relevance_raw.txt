 theu800 concept ofu800  relevance  isu800 studied inu800 many different fields including cognitive sciences logic andu800 library andu800 information science . most fundamentally however itu800 isu800 studied inu800 epistemology theu800 theory ofu800 knowledge . different theories ofu800 knowledge have different implications foru800 what isu800 considered relevant andu800 these fundamental views have implications foru800 allu800 other fields asu800 well. definition definition definition something au800 isu800 relevant tou800 au800 task tu800 ifu800 itu800 increases theu800 likelihood ofu800 accomplishing theu800 goal gu800 which isu800 implied byu800 tu800. hju8c3b8rland & sejer christensen 2002 . hju8c3b8rland bu800. & sejer christensen fu800. 2002 . work tasks andu800 socio-cognitive relevance au800 specific example. journal ofu800 theu800 american society foru800 information science andu800 technology 53u800 11u800 960u800-965u800. au800 thing might beu800 relevant au800 document oru800 au800 piece ofu800 information mayu800 beu800 relevant. theu800 basic understanding ofu800 relevance does notu800 depend onu800 whether weu800 speak ofu800 things oru800 information . epistemology epistemology epistemology ifu800 youu800 believe that schizophrenia isu800 caused byu800 badu800 communication between mother andu800 child then family interaction studies become relevant. ifu800 onu800 theu800 other hand youu800 subscribe tou800 au800 genetic theory ofu800 relevance then theu800 study ofu800 genes becomes relevant. ifu800 youu800 subscribe tou800 theu800 epistemology ofu800 empiricism then only intersubjectively controlled observations areu800 relevant. ifu800 onu800 theu800 other hand youu800 subscribe tou800 feminist epistemology then theu800 sexu800 ofu800 theu800 observer becomes relevant. epistemology isu800 notu800 just oneu800 domain among others. epistemological views areu800 always atu800 play inu800 anyu800 domain. those views determine oru800 influence what isu800 regarded relevant. relevance logic relevance logic relevance logic inu800 formal reasoning relevance hasu800 proved anu800 important butu800 elusive concept. itu800 isu800 important because theu800 solution ofu800 anyu800 problem requires theu800 prior identification ofu800 theu800 relevant elements from which au800 solution canu800 beu800 constructed. itu800 isu800 elusive because theu800 meaning ofu800 relevance appears tou800 beu800 difficult oru800 impossible tou800 capture within conventional logical system systems. theu800 obvious suggestion that qu800 isu800 relevant tou800 pu800 ifu800 qu800 isu800 implied byu800 pu800 breaks down because under standard definitions ofu800 material conditional material implication au800 false proposition implies allu800 other propositions. however though 'iron isu800 au800 metal' mayu800 beu800 implied byu800 'cats layu800 eggs itu800 doesn'tu800 seem tou800 beu800 relevant tou800 itu800 theu800 wayu800 inu800 which 'cats areu800 mammals andu800 'mammals give birth tou800 living young' areu800 relevant tou800 each other. ifu800 oneu800 states iu800 love iceu800 cream andu800 another person responds iu800 have au800 friend named brad cook then these statements areu800 notu800 relevant. however ifu800 oneu800 states iu800 love iceu800 cream andu800 another person responds iu800 have au800 friend named brad cook whou800 also likes iceu800 cream this statement nowu800 becomes relevant because itu800 relates tou800 theu800 first person person'su800 idea. more recently au800 number ofu800 theorists whou800 date december 2011 have sought tou800 account foru800 relevance inu800 terms ofu800 possible world logics inu800 intensional logic . roughly theu800 idea isu800 that logical truth necessary truth truths areu800 true inu800 allu800 possible worlds contradiction contradictions logical falsehoods areu800 true inu800 nou800 possible worlds andu800 contingency contingent propositions canu800 beu800 ordered inu800 terms ofu800 theu800 number ofu800 possible worlds inu800 which they areu800 true. relevance isu800 argued tou800 depend upon theu800 remoteness relationship between anu800 actual world inu800 which relevance isu800 being evaluated andu800 theu800 setu800 ofu800 possible worlds within which itu800 isu800 true. application application application politics politics politics during theu800 1960s  relevance  became au800 fashionable buzzword meaning roughly 'relevance tou800 social concerns such asu800 racial equality poverty social justice famine world hunger world economic development andu800 sou800 onu800. theu800 implication wasu800 that some subjects eu800u82egu800. theu800 study ofu800 medieval poetry andu800 theu800 practice ofu800 corporate lawu800 were notu800 worthwhile because they didu800 notu800 address pressing social issues . citation needed date september 2011 economics economics economics theu800 economist john maynard keynes sawu800 theu800 importance ofu800 defining relevance tou800 theu800 problem ofu800 calculating risk inu800 economic decision-making. heu800 suggested that theu800 relevance ofu800 au800 piece ofu800 evidence such asu800 au800 true proposition should beu800 defined inu800 terms ofu800 theu800 changes itu800 produces ofu800 estimations ofu800 theu800 probability ofu800 future events. specifically keynes proposed that newu800 evidence eu800 isu800 irrelevant tou800 au800 proposition given oldu800 evidence qu800 ifu800 andu800 only ifu800 pu800 qu800 & eu800 pu800 qu800 andu800 relevant otherwise. there areu800 technical problems with this definition foru800 example theu800 relevance ofu800 au800 piece ofu800 evidence canu800 beu800 sensitive tou800 theu800 order inu800 which other pieces ofu800 evidence areu800 received. cognitive science andu800 pragmatics cognitive science andu800 pragmatics cognitive science andu800 pragmatics further2 relevance theory inu800 1986 danu800 sperber andu800 deirdre wilson drew attention tou800 theu800 central importance ofu800 relevance decisions inu800 reasoning andu800 communication. they proposed anu800 account ofu800 theu800 process ofu800 inferring relevant information from anyu800 given utterance. tou800 dou800 this work they used what they called theu800 principle ofu800 relevance namely theu800 position that  anyu800 utterance addressed tou800 someone automatically conveys theu800 presumption ofu800 itsu800 ownu800 optimal relevance . theu800 central idea ofu800 sperber andu800 wilson wilson'su800 theory isu800 that allu800 utterances areu800 encountered inu800 some context andu800 theu800 correct interpretation ofu800 au800 particular utterance isu800 theu800 oneu800 that allows most newu800 implications tou800 beu800 made inu800 that context onu800 theu800 basis ofu800 theu800 least amount ofu800 information necessary tou800 convey itu800. foru800 sperber andu800 wilson relevance isu800 conceived asu800 relative oru800 subjective asu800 itu800 depends upon theu800 state ofu800 knowledge ofu800 au800 hearer when they encounter anu800 utterance. sperber andu800 wilson stress that this theory isu800 notu800 intended tou800 account foru800 every intuitive application ofu800 theu800 english word relevance . relevance asu800 au800 technical term isu800 restricted tou800 relationships between utterances andu800 interpretations andu800 sou800 theu800 theory cannot account foru800 intuitions such asu800 theu800 oneu800 that relevance relationships obtain inu800 problems involving physical objects. ifu800 au800 plumber needs tou800 fixu800 au800 leaky faucet foru800 example some objects andu800 tools areu800 relevant iu800u82eeu800. au800 wrench andu800 others areu800 notu800 iu800u82eeu800. au800 waffle iron . andu800 moreover theu800 latter seems tou800 beu800 irrelevant inu800 au800 manner which does notu800 depend upon theu800 plumber plumber'su800 knowledge oru800 theu800 utterances used tou800 describe theu800 problem. au800 theory ofu800 relevance that seems tou800 beu800 more readily applicable tou800 such instances ofu800 physical problem solving hasu800 been suggested byu800 gorayska andu800 lindsay inu800 au800 series ofu800 articles published during theu800 1990s. theu800 keyu800 feature ofu800 their theory isu800 theu800 idea that relevance isu800 goal-dependent. anu800 item eu800u82egu800. anu800 utterance oru800 object isu800 relevant tou800 au800 goal ifu800 andu800 only ifu800 itu800 canu800 beu800 anu800 essential element ofu800 some plan capable ofu800 achieving theu800 desired goal. this theory embraces both propositional reasoning andu800 theu800 problem-solving activities ofu800 people such asu800 plumbers andu800 defines relevance inu800 such au800 wayu800 that what isu800 relevant isu800 determined byu800 theu800 real world because what plans will work isu800 au800 matter ofu800 empirical fact rather than theu800 state ofu800 knowledge oru800 belief ofu800 au800 particular problem solver. lawu800 lawu800 lawu800 main relevance lawu800 theu800 meaning ofu800 relevance inu800 uu800u82esu800. lawu800 isu800 reflected inu800 rule 401u800 ofu800 theu800 federal rules ofu800 evidence . that rule defines relevance asu800 having anyu800 tendency tou800 make theu800 existence ofu800 anyu800 fact that isu800 ofu800 consequence tou800 theu800 determination ofu800 theu800 action more probable oru800 less probable than itu800 would beu800 without theu800 evidence. inu800 other words ifu800 au800 fact were tou800 have nou800 bearing onu800 theu800 truth oru800 falsity ofu800 au800 conclusion itu800 would beu800 legally irrelevant. library andu800 information science library
