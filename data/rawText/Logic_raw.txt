dialogues ofu800 plato areu800 good examples ofu800 informal logic.   mathematical formalism formal logic   isu800 theu800 study ofu800 inference with purely formal content. anu800 inference possesses

definitions ofu800 logic logical consequence logical inference andu800 inference with purely formal content areu800 theu800 same. this does notu800 render theu800 notion ofu800 informal logic vacuous because nou800 formal logic captures allu800 ofu800 theu800 nuance ofu800 natural language.   symbolic logic   isu800 theu800 study ofu800 symbolic abstractions that capture theu800 formal features ofu800 logical inference. symbolic logic isu800 often divided into twou800 branches propositional logic andu800 predicate logic .   mathematical logic   isu800 anu800 extension ofu800 symbolic logic

generally considered  formal  when itu800 analyzes andu800 represents theu800  form  ofu800 anyu800 valid argument type. theu800 form ofu800 anu800 argument isu800 displayed byu800 representing itsu800 sentences inu800 theu800 formal grammar andu800 symbolism ofu800 au800 logical language tou800 make itsu800 content usable inu800 formal inference. ifu800 oneu800 considers theu800 notion ofu800 form toou800 philosophically loaded oneu800 could sayu800 that formalizing simply means translating english sentences into theu800 language ofu800 logic. this isu800 called showing theu800  logical form  ofu800 theu800 argument. itu800 isu800 necessary because indicative sentences ofu800 ordinary language show au800 considerable variety ofu800 form andu800 complexity that makes their useu800 inu800 inference impractical. itu800 requires first ignoring those grammatical features irrelevant tou800 logic such asu800 gender andu800 declension ifu800 theu800 argument isu800 inu800 latin replacing conjunctions irrelevant tou800 logic such asu800 'butu800' with logical conjunctions like 'andu800' andu800 replacing ambiguous oru800 alternative logical expressions 'anyu800' 'every' etcu800. with expressions ofu800 au800 standard type such asu800 'allu800' oru800 theu800 universal quantifier u8e28880 . second certain parts ofu800 theu800 sentence must beu800 replaced with schematic letters. thus foru800 example theu800 expression  allu800 asu800 areu800 bsu800  shows theu800 logical form common tou800 theu800 sentences  allu800 menu800 areu800 mortals   allu800 cats

aristotle uses variable letters tou800 represent valid inferences inu800   prior analytics   leading janu800 u8c582ukasiewicz tou800 sayu800 that theu800 introduction ofu800 variables wasu800 'oneu800 ofu800 aristotle aristotle'su800 greatest inventions'. according tou800 theu800 followers ofu800 aristotle such asu800 ammonius saccas ammonius only theu800 logical principles stated inu800 schematic terms belong tou800 logic notu800 those given inu800 concrete terms. theu800 concrete terms  manu800' 'mortal  etcu800. areu800 analogous tou800 theu800 substitution values ofu800 theu800 schematic placeholders 'au800' 'bu800' 'cu800' which were called theu800 'matter' greek 'hyle' ofu800 theu800 inference. theu800 fundamental difference between modern formal logic andu800 traditional oru800 aristotelian logic lies inu800 their differing analysis ofu800 theu800 logical form ofu800 theu800 sentences they treat. inu800 theu800 traditional view theu800 form ofu800 theu800 sentence consists ofu800 1u800 au800 subject eu800u82egu800. 'manu800' plus au800 sign ofu800 quantity 'allu800' oru800 'some' oru800 'nou800' ; 2u800 theu800 copula linguistics copula which isu800 ofu800 theu800 form 'isu800 oru800 'isu800 notu800'; 3u800 au800 predicate eu800u82egu800. 'mortal' . thus allu800 menu800 areu800 mortal. theu800 logical constants such asu800 'allu800' 'nou800' andu800 sou800 onu800 plus sentential connectives such asu800 'andu800' andu800 'oru800' were called 'syncategorematic' terms from theu800 greek 'kategorei' u8e28093 tou800 predicate andu800 'synu800' u8e28093 together with . this isu800 au800 fixed scheme where each judgment hasu800 anu800 identified quantity andu800 copula determining theu800 logical form ofu800 theu800 sentence. according tou800 theu800 modern view theu800 fundamental form ofu800 au800 simple sentence isu800 given byu800 au800 recursive schema involving logical connective connectives such asu800 au800 quantifier with itsu800 bound variable which areu800 joined tou800 byu800 juxtaposition tou800 other sentences which inu800 turn mayu800 have logical structure. theu800 modern view isu800 more complex since au800 single judgement ofu800 aristotle aristotle'su800 system involves twou800 oru800 more logical connectives. foru800 example theu800 sentence allu800 menu800 areu800 mortal involves inu800 term logic twou800 nonu800-logical terms isu800 au800 manu800 here  mu800  andu800 isu800 mortal here  du800  theu800 sentence isu800 given byu800 theu800 judgement au800 mu800 du800 . inu800 predicate logic theu800 sentence involves theu800 same twou800 nonu800-logical concepts here analyzed asu800 mu800 xu800 andu800 du800 xu800 andu800 theu800 sentence isu800 given byu800 forall xu800. mu800 xu800 rightarrow du800 xu800 involving theu800 logical connectives foru800 universal quantification andu800 material conditional implication . butu800 equally theu800 modern view isu800 more powerful. medieval logicians recognized theu800 problem ofu800 multiple generality where aristotelian logic isu800 unable tou800 satisfactorily render such sentences asu800 some guys have allu800 theu800 luck because both quantities allu800 andu800 some mayu800 beu800 relevant inu800 anu800 inference butu800 theu800 fixed scheme that aristotle used allows only oneu800 tou800 govern theu800 inference. just asu800 linguists recognize recursive structure inu800 natural languages itu800 appears that logic needs recursive structure. deductive andu800 inductive reasoning andu800 retroductive inference deductive andu800 inductive reasoning andu800 retroductive inference deductive andu800 inductive reasoning andu800 retroductive inference deductive reasoning concerns what follows necessarily from given premises ifu800 au800 then bu800 . however inductive reasoning u8e28094the process ofu800 deriving au800 reliable generalization from observationsu8e28094has sometimes been included inu800 theu800 study ofu800 logic. similarly itu800 isu800 important tou800 distinguish deductive validity andu800 inductive validity called cogency . anu800 inference isu800 deductively valid ifu800 andu800 only ifu800 there isu800 nou800 possible situation inu800 which allu800 theu800 premises areu800 true butu800 theu800 conclusion false. anu800 inductive argument canu800 beu800 neither valid noru800 invalid; itsu800 premises give only some degree ofu800 probability butu800 notu800 certainty tou800 itsu800 conclusion. theu800 notion ofu800 deductive validity canu800 beu800 rigorously stated foru800 systems ofu800 formal logic inu800 terms ofu800 theu800 well-understood notions ofu800 semantics . inductive validity onu800 theu800 other hand requires usu800 tou800 define au800 reliable generalization ofu800 some setu800 ofu800 observations. theu800 task ofu800 providing this definition mayu800 beu800 approached inu800 various ways some less formal than others; some ofu800 these definitions mayu800 useu800 mathematical model models ofu800 probability. foru800 theu800 most part this discussion ofu800 logic deals only with deductive logic. retroductive inference isu800 au800 mode ofu800 reasoning that peirce proposed asu800 operating over andu800 above induction andu800

theu800 term soundness hasu800 multiple separate meanings which creates au800 bitu800 ofu800 confusion throughout theu800 literature. most commonly soundness refers tou800 logical systems which means

ofu800 logic logic arose seeu800 below from au800 concern with correctness ofu800 argumentation . modern logicians usually wish tou800 ensure that logic studies just those arguments that arise from

andu800 merely asserts them rhetorically. although since heu800 isu800 criticising theu800 established criteria ofu800 validity this does notu800 undermine hisu800 position foru800 oneu800 could argue that theu800 demonstration ofu800 validity provided inu800 theu800 name ofu800 logic wasu800 just asu800 rhetorically based. some philosophers such asu800 ju8c3bcrgen habermas claim hisu800 position isu800 self-refutingu8e28094and accuse nietszche ofu800 notu800 even having au800 coherent perspective letu800 alone au800 theory ofu800 knowledge. again itu800 isu800 unclear ifu800 this isu800 au800 decisive critique foru800 theu800 criteria ofu800 coherency andu800 consistent theory areu800 exactly what isu800 under question. georg lukacs inu800 hisu800 book  theu800 destruction ofu800 reason  asserts that were weu800 tou800 study nietzsche nietzsche'su800 statements inu800 this area from au800 logico-philosophical angle weu800 would beu800 confronted byu800 au800 dizzy chaos ofu800 theu800
