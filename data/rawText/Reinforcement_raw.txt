schedules ofu800 reinforcement areu800 au800 type ofu800 compound schedule that evolved from theu800 initial work onu800 simple schedules ofu800 reinforcement byu800 bu800u82efu800. skinner andu800 hisu800 colleagues skinner andu800 ferster 1957 . they demonstrated that reinforcers could beu800 delivered onu800 schedules andu800 further that organisms behaved differently under different schedules. rather than au800 reinforcer such asu800 food oru800 water being delivered every time asu800 au800 consequence ofu800 some behavior au800 reinforcer could beu800 delivered after more than oneu800 instance ofu800 theu800 behavior. foru800 example au800 pigeon mayu800 beu800 required tou800 peck au800 button switch tenu800 times before food appears. this isu800 au800 ratio schedule . also au800 reinforcer could beu800 delivered after anu800 interval ofu800 time passed following au800 target behavior. anu800 example isu800 au800 ratu800 that isu800 given au800 food pellet immediately following theu800 first response that occurs after twou800 minutes hasu800 elapsed since theu800 last lever press. this isu800 called anu800 interval schedule . inu800 addition ratio schedules canu800 deliver reinforcement following fixed oru800 variable number ofu800 behaviors byu800 theu800 individual organism. likewise interval schedules canu800 deliver reinforcement following fixed oru800 variable intervals ofu800 time following au800 single response byu800 theu800 organism. individual behaviors tend tou800 generate response rates that differ based upon howu800 theu800

social trap traps such asu800 when humans overharvest their fisheries oru800 tear down their rainforests. brechner created au800 situation where simple reinforcement schedules were superimposed upon

thought ofu800 asu800 oru800 schedules andu800 superimposed schedules ofu800 reinforcement canu800 beu800 thought ofu800 asu800 andu800 schedules. brechner andu800 linder 1981 andu800 brechner 1987

superimposed schedules ofu800 reinforcement have many real-world applications inu800 addition tou800 generating social trap traps. many different human individual andu800 social situations canu800 beu800 created byu800 superimposing simple reinforcement schedules. foru800 example au800 human being could have simultaneous tobacco andu800 alcohol addictions. even more complex situations canu800 beu800 created oru800 simulated byu800 superimposing twou800 oru800 more concurrent schedules. foru800 example au800 high school senior could have au800 choice between going tou800 stanford university

antecedent foru800 theu800 next behavior. there areu800 many ways tou800 teach chaining such asu800 forward chaining starting from theu800 first behavior inu800 theu800 chain backwards chaining starting from theu800 last behavior andu800 total task chaining inu800 which theu800 entire behavior isu800 taught from beginning tou800 endu800 rather than asu800 au800 series ofu800 steps . anu800 example isu800 opening au800 locked door. first theu800 keyu800 isu800 inserted then turned then theu800 door opened. forward chaining would teach theu800 subject first tou800 insert theu800 keyu800. once that task isu800 mastered they areu800 told tou800 insert theu800 keyu800 andu800 taught tou800 turn itu800. once that task isu800 mastered they areu800 told tou800 perform theu800 first twou800 then taught tou800 open theu800 door. backwards chaining would involve theu800 teacher first inserting andu800 turning theu800 keyu800 andu800 theu800 subject isu800 taught tou800 open theu800 door. once that isu800 learned theu800 teacher inserts theu800 keyu800 andu800 theu800 subject isu800 taught tou800 turn itu800 then opens theu800 door asu800 theu800 next step. finally theu800 subject isu800 taught tou800 insert theu800 keyu800 andu800 they turn andu800 open theu800 door. once theu800 first step isu800 mastered theu800 entire task hasu800 been taught. total task chaining would involve teaching theu800 entire task asu800 au800 single series prompting through allu800 steps. prompts areu800 faded reduced atu800 each step asu800 they areu800 mastered. persuasive communication &

more other individuals andu800 deliberately sets outu800 tou800 secure theu800 response through theu800 useu800 ofu800 communication. theu800 communicator must realize that different groups have
