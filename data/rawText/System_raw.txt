inu800 offering these more global definitions theu800 author maintains that itu800 isu800 important notu800 tou800 confuse oneu800 foru800 theu800 other. theu800 theorist explains that natural systems

checkland 1997; flood 1999. hard systems areu800 associated with areas such asu800 systems engineering operations research andu800 quantitative systems analysis. soft systems areu800 commonly
