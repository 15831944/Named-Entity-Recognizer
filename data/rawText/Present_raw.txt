theu800 past andu800 theu800 future . modern physics hasu800 notu800 yetu800 been able tou800 explain theu800 perceived aspect ofu800 'theu800 present' asu800 'eliminator ofu800 possibilities that transfers future into past. physical laws formally areu800 valid atu800 anyu800 point ofu800 time classical oru800 quantum mechanics oru800 even globally general relativity there isnu800'tu800 au800 concept ofu800 au800  present time  inu800 this context. au800 complicating factor isu800 that whilst au800 given observer would describe 'theu800 present' asu800 au800 spatial structure with au800 zero-length time lapse other observers would associate both time andu800 space tou800 this structure andu800 therefore disagree onu800 what constitutes 'theu800 present'. theu800 direct experience ofu800 theu800 present foru800 each human isu800 that itu800 isu800 what isu800 here nowu800. direct experience isu800 ofu800 course subjective byu800 definition yetu800 inu800 this case this same direct experience isu800 true foru800 allu800 humans. foru800 allu800 ofu800 usu800 'here' means 'where iu800 amu800' andu800 'nowu800' means 'when iu800 amu800'. thus theu800 common repeatable experience isu800 that theu800 present isu800 inextricably linked tou800 oneself. inu800 theu800 time aspect theu800 conventional concept ofu800 'nowu800' isu800 that itu800 isu800 some tiny point onu800 au800 continuous timeline which separates past from future. itu800 isu800 notu800 clear however that there isu800 au800 universal timeline oru800 whether asu800 relativity seems tou800 indicate theu800 timeline isu800 inextricably linked tou800 theu800 observer. thus isu800 'nowu800' foru800 oneu800 observer theu800 same time asu800 'nowu800' foru800 another onu800 au800 universal timeline assuming au800 universal timeline exists adding tou800 theu800 confusion inu800 theu800 physics view there isu800 nou800 demonstrable reason whyu800 time should move inu800 anyu800 oneu800 particular direction. theu800 laws ofu800 physics simply areu800 valid atu800 anyu800 point inu800 time they describe events atu800 16u800 45u800 yesterday andu800 describe events atu800 20u800 45u800 tomorrow. theu800 idea that time moves isnu800'tu800 contained inu800 these laws. adding substance tou800 theu800 supposition that theu800 timeline view ofu800 'nowu800' mayu800 notu800 hold theu800 full picture theu800 qualities ofu800 'nowu800' oru800 theu800 'present' inu800 theu800 human direct experience areu800 very different from theu800 qualities ofu800 past andu800 future available through memory oru800 anticipation. inu800 theu800 human direct experience 'nowu800' hasu800 au800 certain aliveness reality andu800 immediacy notu800 present inu800 ouru800 concepts ofu800 past andu800 future. indeed anyu800 experience isu800 always happening 'nowu800' even au800 reu800-living ofu800 some past event. thus there isu800 au800 deep philosophical case foru800 saying that theu800 present moment isu800 allu800 there ever isu800 from moment tou800 moment. when comparing time inu800 places separated byu800 great distances theu800 notion ofu800  present  becomes more subjective. foru800 example weu800 visually perceive star stars tou800 beu800 where they were when theu800 light nowu800 reaching ouru800 eyes wasu800 emitted because even though light travels atu800 approximately speed
