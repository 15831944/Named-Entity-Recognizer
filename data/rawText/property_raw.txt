problem. only when items areu800 relatively scarce with respect tou800 people people'su800 desires dou800 they become property. foru800 example hunter-gatherers didu800 notu800 consider land tou800 beu800 property since there wasu800 nou800 shortage ofu800 land. agrarian societies later made arable land property asu800 itu800 wasu800 scarce. foru800 something tou800 beu800 economically scarce itu800 must necessarily have theu800  exclusivity property &mdash;that useu800 byu800 oneu800 person excludes others from using itu800. these twou800 justifications lead tou800 different conclusions onu800 what canu800 beu800 property. intellectual property &mdash;incorporeal things like ideas plans orderings andu800 arrangements musical compositions novels computer programs &mdash;areu800 generally considered valid property tou800 those whou800 support anu800 effort justification butu800 invalid tou800 those whou800 support au800 scarcity justification since theu800 things donu800'tu800 have theu800 exclusivity property however those whou800 support au800 scarcity justification mayu800 still support other intellectual property laws such asu800 copyright asu800 long

oneu800'su800 body isu800 oneu800 oneu800'su800 property. from some anarchism anarchist points ofu800 view theu800 validity ofu800 property depends onu800 whether theu800 property right requires enforcement byu800 theu800 state. different forms ofu800 property require different amounts ofu800 enforcement intellectual property requires au800 great deal ofu800 state intervention tou800 enforce ownership ofu800 distant physical property requires quite au800 lotu800 ownership ofu800 carried objects requires very little while ownership ofu800 oneu800 oneu800'su800 ownu800 body requires absolutely nou800 state intervention. some anarchism anarchists donu800'tu800 believe inu800 property atu800 allu800. many things have existed that didu800 notu800 have anu800 owner sometimes called theu800 commons . theu800 term commons however isu800 also often used tou800 mean something quite different general collective ownership &mdash;iu800u82eeu800. common ownership . also theu800 same term isu800 sometimes used byu800 statism statists tou800 mean government-owned property that theu800 general public isu800 allowed tou800 access public property . lawu800 inu800 allu800 societies hasu800 tended tou800 develop towards reducing theu800 number ofu800 things notu800 having clear owners. supporters ofu800 property rights argue that this enables better protection ofu800 scarce resources dueu800 tou800 theu800 tragedy ofu800 theu800 commons while critics argue that itu800 leads tou800 theu800 'exploitation' ofu800 those resources foru800 personal gain andu800 that itu800 hinders taking advantage ofu800 potential network effects . these arguments have differing validity foru800 different types ofu800 property &mdash;things that areu800 notu800 scarce areu800 foru800

andu800 possible must necessarily have equality foru800 itsu800 condition. hisu800 analysis ofu800 theu800 product ofu800 labor upon natural resources asu800 property usufruct isu800 more nuanced. heu800 asserts that land itself cannot beu800 property yetu800 itu800 should beu800 held byu800 individual possessors asu800 stewards ofu800 mankind with theu800 product ofu800 labor being theu800 property ofu800 theu800 producer. proudhon reasoned that anyu800 wealth gained without labor wasu800 stolen from those whou800 labored tou800 create that wealth. even au800 voluntary contract tou800 surrender theu800 product ofu800 labor tou800 anu800 employer wasu800 theft according tou800 proudhon since theu800 controller ofu800 natural resources hadu800 nou800 moral right tou800 charge others

'su800 main treatise onu800 property canu800 beu800 found inu800 chapter 8u800 ofu800 hisu800 book  economic harmonies  1850 . inu800 au800 radical departure from traditional property theory heu800 defines property notu800 asu800 au800 physical object butu800 rather asu800 au800 relationship between people with respect tou800 anu800 object. thus saying oneu800 owns au800 glass ofu800 water isu800 merely verbal shorthand foru800  iu800 mayu800 justly gift oru800 trade this water tou800 another person . inu800 essence what oneu800 owns isu800 notu800 theu800 object butu800 theu800 value ofu800 theu800 object. byu800 value bastiat apparently means  market value ; heu800 emphasizes that this isu800 quite different from utility.   inu800 ouru800 relations with oneu800 another weu800 areu800 notu800 owners ofu800 theu800 utility ofu800 things butu800 ofu800 their value andu800 value isu800 theu800 appraisal made ofu800 reciprocal services.   strongly disputing proudhon proudhon'su800 equality-based argument bastiat theorizes that asu800 au800 result ofu800 technological progress andu800 theu800 division ofu800 labor theu800 stock ofu800 communal wealth increases over time; that theu800 hours ofu800 work anu800 unskilled laborer expends tou800 buyu800 eu800u82egu800. 100u800 liters ofu800 wheat decreases over time thus amounting tou800 gratis satisfaction. thus private property continually destroys itself becoming transformed into communal wealth. theu800 increasing proportion ofu800 communal wealth tou800 private property results inu800 au800 tendency toward equality ofu800 mankind.   since theu800 human race started from theu800 point ofu800 greatest poverty that isu800 from theu800 point where there were theu800 most obstacles tou800 beu800 overcome itu800 isu800 clear that allu800 that hasu800 been gained from oneu800 erau800 tou800 theu800 next hasu800 been dueu800 tou800 theu800 spirit ofu800 property.   this transformation ofu800 private property into theu800 communal domain bastiat points outu800 does notu800 imply that private property will ever totally disappear. this isu800 because manu800 asu800 heu800 progresses continually invents newu800 andu800 more sophisticated needs andu800 desires. contemporary views contemporary views contemporary views among contemporary political thinkers whou800 believe that natural persons enjoy rights tou800 ownu800 property andu800 tou800 enter into contracts there areu800 twou800 views about john locke. onu800 theu800 oneu800 hand there areu800 ardent locke admirers such asu800 william harold hutt wu800u82ehu800. hutt 1956 whou800 praised locke foru800 laying down theu800 quintessence ofu800 individualism. onu800 theu800 other hand there areu800 those such asu800 richard pipes whou800 think that locke locke'su800 arguments areu800 weak andu800 that undue reliance thereon hasu800 weakened theu800 cause ofu800 individualism inu800 recent times. pipes hasu800 written that locke locke'su800 work marked au800 regression because itu800 rested onu800 theu800 concept ofu800 natural lawu800 rather than upon harrington harrington'su800 sociological framework.
