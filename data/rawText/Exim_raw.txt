ifu800 au800 feature oru800 some behaviour isu800 notu800 documented then this isu800 classed asu800 au800 bugu800. theu800 documentation consists ofu800 theu800 exim specification andu800 twou800 ancillary files theu800 experimental specification foru800 features that might disappear andu800 newstuff which tracks very recent changes that might notu800 have been fully integrated into theu800 main specification. theu800 exim specification isu800 available inu800 multiple formats including online inu800 html andu800 inu800 plain-text foru800 fast searching. theu800 document preparation system ensures that theu800 plain-text format isu800 highly usable. performance performance performance exim hasu800 been deployed inu800 busy environments often handling thousands ofu800 emails peru800 hour efficiently. exim isu800 designed tou800 deliver email immediately without queueing. however itsu800 queue processing performance isu800 comparatively poor when queues areu800 large which happens rarely onu800 typical lowu800-traffic sites butu800 canu800 happen regularly onu800 high-traffic sites . unlike qmail postfix software postfix andu800 zmailer exim does notu800 have au800 central queue manager iu800u82eeu800. anu800 equivalent ofu800  qmail-send   qmgr  oru800  scheduler  . there isu800 thus nou800 centralized load balancing either ofu800 queue processing leading tou800 disproportionate amounts ofu800 time being spent onu800 processing theu800 same queue entries repeatedly oru800 ofu800 system-wide remote transport concurrency leading tou800 au800 thundering herd problem when multiple messages addressed tou800 au800 single domain areu800 submitted atu800 once . inu800 philip hazel hazel'su800 ownu800 words posting byu800 philip hazel theu800 bottom line isu800 that exim does notu800 perform particularly well inu800 environments where theu800 queue regularly gets very large. itu800 wasu800 never designed foru800 this; deliveries from theu800 queue were always intended tou800 beu800 'exceptions rather than theu800 norm. however theu800 interfaces tou800 theu800 spool system areu800 well defined andu800 various people have written their ownu800 spool management daemons tou800 useu800 instead ofu800 asking theu800 listening daemon tou800 periodically fork queue runners. citation needed reason need tou800 digu800 outu800 theu800 mailing-list posts where people have discussed their replacements date november 2009 inu800 1997 philip hazel replaced exim exim'su800 posix regular expression library written byu800 henry spencer with au800 newu800 library heu800 developed called pcre perl compatible regular expressions . perl regular expressions areu800 much more powerful than posix andu800 other common regular expressions andu800 pcre hasu800 become popular inu800 applications other than exim. updates updates updates historically exim used au800 peculiar version numbering scheme where theu800 first decimal digit isu800 updated only whenever theu800 main documentation isu800 fully upu800 tou800 date; until that time changes were accumulated inu800 theu800 file newstuff. foru800 this reason au800 0u800u82e01u800 version change canu800 signify important changes notu800 necessarily fully documented. exim&#93u800;
