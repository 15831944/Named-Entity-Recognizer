tou800 refer tou800 theu800 moment atu800 which life ends. however determining when death hasu800 occurred requires drawing precise conceptual boundaries between life andu800 death. this isu800 problematic because there isu800 little consensus over howu800 tou800 define life. this general problem applies tou800 theu800 particular challenge ofu800 defining death inu800 theu800 context ofu800

isu800 inu800 defining consciousness which hasu800 many different definitions given byu800 modern scientists psychologists andu800 philosophers. additionally many religious traditions including abrahamic religions abrahamic andu800 dharmic religions dharmic traditions hold that death does notu800 oru800 mayu800 notu800 entail theu800 endu800 ofu800 consciousness. inu800 certain cultures

english dictionary inu800 this context death describes merely theu800 state where something hasu800 ceased foru800 example life. thus theu800 definition ofu800 life simultaneously defines death. historically attempts tou800 define theu800 exact moment ofu800 au800 human human'su800 death have been problematic. death wasu800 once defined asu800 theu800 cessation ofu800 heart heartbeat cardiac arrest andu800 ofu800 breath breathing butu800 theu800 development ofu800 cardiopulmonary resuscitation cpru800 andu800 prompt defibrillation have rendered that definition inadequate because breathing andu800 heartbeat canu800 sometimes beu800 restarted. events which were causality causally linked tou800 death inu800 theu800 past nou800 longer kill inu800 allu800 circumstances; without au800 functioning heart oru800 lungs life canu800 sometimes beu800 sustained with au800 combination ofu800 life support devices organ transplants andu800 artificial pacemaker pacemakers. today where au800 definition ofu800 theu800 moment ofu800 death isu800 required doctors andu800 coroners usually turn tou800 brain death oru800 biological death tou800 define au800 person asu800 being dead; people areu800 considered dead when theu800 electrical activity inu800 their brain ceases. itu800 isu800 presumed that anu800 endu800 ofu800 electrical activity indicates theu800 endu800 ofu800 consciousness . however suspension ofu800 consciousness must beu800 permanent andu800 notu800 transient asu800 occurs during certain nonu800-rapid eyeu800 movement sleep sleep stages andu800 especially au800 coma . inu800 theu800 case ofu800 sleep electroencephalography eegs canu800 easily tell theu800 difference. however theu800 category ofu800 brain death isu800 seen byu800 some scholars tou800 beu800
