sexual relations. asu800 heu800 observes competition foru800 sexual access limits theu800 possibilities foru800 social cooperation inu800 many species; yetu800 deacon observes there areu800 three consistent patterns inu800 human reproduction that distinguish them from other species # both males andu800 females usually contribute effort towards theu800 rearing ofu800 their offspring though often tou800 differing extents andu800 inu800 very different ways. # inu800 allu800 societies theu800 great majority ofu800 adult males andu800 females areu800 bound byu800 long-term exclusive sexual

deacon does notu800 believe that symbolic thought wasu800 necessary foru800 hunting oru800 tool-making although tool-making mayu800 beu800 au800 reliable index ofu800 symbolic thought ; rather itu800 wasu800 necessary foru800 theu800 success ofu800 distinctive social relations. theu800 keyu800 isu800 that while menu800 andu800 women areu800 equally effective foragers mothers carrying dependent children areu800 notu800 effective hunters. they must thus depend onu800 male hunters. this favors au800 system inu800 which males have exclusive sexual access tou800 females andu800 females canu800 predict that their sexual partner will provide food foru800 them andu800 their children. inu800 most mammalian species theu800 result isu800 au800 system ofu800 rank oru800 sexual competition that

isu800 uniquely characteristic about human societies isu800 what required symbolic cognition which consequently leads tou800 theu800 evolution ofu800 culture cooperative mixed-sexu800 social groups

occasion hunt meat; inu800 most cases however males consume theu800 meat immediately andu800 only onu800 occasion share with females whou800 happen tou800 beu800 nearby. among chimpanzees hunting foru800 meat increases when other sources ofu800 food become scarce butu800 under these conditions sharing decreases. theu800 first forms ofu800 symbolic thinking made stone tools possible which inu800 turn made hunting foru800 meat au800 more dependable source ofu800 food foru800 ouru800 nonhuman ancestors while making possible forms ofu800 social communication that make sharing between

theu800 most essential carrier ofu800 their common culture. boas wasu800 theu800 first anthropologist whou800 considered itu800 unimaginable tou800 study theu800 culture ofu800 au800 foreign people without also becoming acquainted with their language. foru800 boas theu800 fact that theu800 intellectual culture ofu800 au800 people wasu800 largely constructed shared andu800 maintained through theu800 useu800 ofu800 language meant that understanding theu800 language ofu800 au800 cultural group wasu800 theu800 keyu800 tou800 understanding itsu800 culture. atu800 theu800 same time though boas andu800 hisu800 students were aware that culture andu800 language areu800 notu800 directly dependent onu800 oneu800 another. that isu800 groups with widely different cultures mayu800 share au800 common language andu800 speakers ofu800 completely unrelated languages mayu800 share theu800 same fundamental cultural traits. sapir 1921 228u800 sapir 1995 59u800 numerous other scholars have suggested that theu800 form ofu800 language determines specific cultural traits. eu800u82egu800. vonu800 humbolt wilhelm. 1820.  u8c3bcber dasu800 vergleichende sprachstudium inu800 beziehung aufu800

thought. while boas himself rejected au800 causal link between language andu800 culture some ofu800 hisu800 intellectual heirs entertained theu800 idea that habitual patterns ofu800 speaking andu800 thinking inu800 au800 particular language mayu800 influence theu800 culture ofu800 theu800 linguistic group. sfnu800 whorf 1941 such belief isu800 related tou800 theu800 theory ofu800 linguistic

andu800 theu800 origin ofu800 complex culture isu800 often thought tou800 stem from theu800 same evolutionary process inu800 early manu800. evolutionary anthropologist robin iu800. dunbar hasu800 proposed that language evolved asu800 early humans began tou800 live inu800 large communities which required theu800 useu800 ofu800 complex communication tou800 maintain social coherence. language andu800 culture then both emerged asu800 au800 means ofu800 using symbols tou800 construct social identity andu800 maintain coherence within au800 social group toou800 large tou800 rely exclusively onu800 preu800-human ways ofu800 building community such asu800 foru800 example social grooming grooming . since language andu800 culture areu800 both inu800 essence symbolic systems twentieth century cultural theorists have applied theu800 methods ofu800 analyzing language developed inu800 theu800 science ofu800 linguistics tou800 also analyze culture. particularly theu800 structuralism structural

beu800 applied widely inu800 theu800 study ofu800 culture. butu800 also post-structuralist theories that nonetheless still rely onu800 theu800 parallel between language andu800 culture asu800 systems ofu800 symbolic communication have been applied inu800 theu800 field ofu800 semiotics . theu800 parallel between language andu800 culture canu800 then beu800 understood asu800 analog tou800 theu800 parallel between au800 linguistic sign consisting foru800 example ofu800 theu800 sound kauu800 andu800 theu800 meaning cowu800 andu800 au800 cultural sign consisting foru800 example ofu800 theu800 cultural form ofu800 wearing au800 crown andu800 theu800 cultural meaning ofu800 being king . inu800 this wayu800 itu800 canu800 beu800 argued that culture isu800 itself au800 kind ofu800 language. another parallel between cultural andu800 linguistic systems isu800 that they areu800 both systems ofu800 practice that isu800 they areu800 au800 setu800 ofu800 special ways ofu800 doing things that isu800 constructed andu800 perpetuated through social interactions. duranti 1997 49u800 mannheim & tedlock 1995 2u800 children foru800 example acquire language inu800 theu800 same wayu800 asu800 they

understood asu800 theu800 particular setu800 ofu800 speech norms ofu800 au800 particular community areu800 also au800 part ofu800 theu800 larger culture ofu800 theu800 community that speak them. humans useu800 language asu800 au800 wayu800 ofu800 signalling identity with oneu800 cultural group andu800 difference from others. even among speakers ofu800 oneu800 language several different ways ofu800 using theu800 language exist andu800 each isu800 used tou800 signal affiliation with particular subgroups within au800 larger culture. inu800 linguistics such different ways ofu800 using theu800 same language areu800 called variety linguistics varieties . foru800 example theu800 english language isu800 spoken differently inu800 theu800 usau800 theu800 uku800 andu800 australia andu800 even within english-speaking countries there areu800 hundreds ofu800 dialect dialects ofu800 english that each signals au800 belonging tou800 au800 particular region andu800 oru800 subculture. foru800 example inu800 theu800 uku800 theu800 cockney dialect signals itsu800 speakers belonging tou800 theu800 group ofu800 lower class workers ofu800 east london. differences between varieties ofu800 theu800 same language often consist inu800 different pronunciations andu800 vocabulary butu800 also sometimes ofu800 different grammatical systems andu800 very often inu800 using different style

pu800u82e46u800 although benedict felt that virtually allu800 cultures areu800 patterned sheu800 argued that these patterns change over time asu800 au800 consequence ofu800 human creativity andu800

theu800 individual individual'su800 illusions ofu800 autonomy andu800 that foru800 many this made existence empty. harvnb benedict 1934 pu800u82e277u800 sheu800 argued however that once people accepted theu800 results ofu800 scientific research people would arrive then atu800 au800 more realistic social faith accepting asu800 grounds ofu800 hope andu800 asu800 newu800 bases foru800 tolerance theu800 coexisting andu800 equally valid patterns ofu800 life which mankind hasu800 created foru800 itself from theu800 rawu800 materials ofu800 existence. this view ofu800 culture hasu800 hadu800 au800 tremendous impact outside ofu800 anthropology andu800 dominated american anthropology until theu800 cold waru800 when anthropologists like sidney mintz andu800 eric wolf rejected theu800

byu800 theu800 1940s some felt ready. whereas kroeber andu800 benedict hadu800 argued that culture u8e28094which could refer tou800 local regional oru800 trans-regional scalesu8e28094was inu800 some wayu800 patterned oru800 configured some anthropologists nowu800 felt that enough data hadu800 been collected tou800 demonstrate that itu800 often took highly structured forms. theu800 question these

abstract models ofu800 human nature. hisu800 method begins with theu800 supposition that culture exists inu800 twou800 different forms theu800 many distinct structures that could beu800 inferred from observing members ofu800 theu800 same society interact andu800 ofu800 which members ofu800 au800 society areu800 themselves aware andu800 abstract structures developed byu800 analyzing shared ways such asu800 myth myths andu800 ritual rituals members ofu800 au800 society represent their social life andu800 ofu800 which members ofu800 au800 society areu800 notu800 only  notu800  consciously aware butu800 which moreover typically stand inu800 opposition tou800 oru800 negate theu800 social structures ofu800 which people  areu800  aware . heu800 then sought tou800 develop oneu800 universal mental structure that could only beu800 inferred through theu800 systematic comparison ofu800 particular social andu800 cultural structures. heu800 argued that just asu800 there areu800 laws through which au800 finite andu800 relatively small number ofu800 chemical elements could beu800 combined tou800 create au800 seemingly infinite variety ofu800 things there were au800 finite andu800 relatively small number ofu800 cultural elements which people combine tou800 create theu800 great variety ofu800 cultures anthropologists observe. theu800 systematic comparison ofu800 societies would enable anu800 anthropologist tou800 develop this cultural table ofu800 elements andu800 once completed this table ofu800 cultural elements would enable anu800 anthropologist tou800 analyze specific cultures andu800 achieve insights hidden tou800 theu800 very people whou800 produced andu800 lived through these cultures. lu8c3a9vi-strauss claude 1955  tristes tropiques  atheneum press

this strain ofu800 thinking hasu800 some influence from theu800 frankfurt school butu800 especially from theu800 structuralism structuralist marxism ofu800 louis althusser andu800 others. theu800 main focus ofu800 anu800 orthodox marxist approach concentrates onu800 theu800  production  ofu800 value personal andu800 cultural meaning . this model assumes au800 mass production ofu800 culture andu800

themselves from this view. they criticize theu800 marxist assumption ofu800 au800 single dominant meaning shared byu800 allu800 foru800 anyu800 cultural product. theu800 nonu800-marxist approaches suggest that different ways ofu800 consuming cultural artifacts affect theu800 meaning ofu800 theu800 product. this view isu800 best exemplified byu800 theu800 book  doing cultural studies theu800 case ofu800 theu800 sony walkman  byu800 paul duu800 gayu800 etu800 alu800. which seeks tou800 challenge theu800 notion that those whou800 produce commodities control theu800 meanings that people
