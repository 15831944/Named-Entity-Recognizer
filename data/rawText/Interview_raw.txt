anu800 interviewer generally enters each interview with au800 predetermined standardized setu800 ofu800 questions itu800 isu800 important that they also asku800 follow-upu800 questions throughout theu800 process. such questions might encourage au800 participant tou800 elaborate upon something poignant that theyu8e28099ve shared andu800 areu800 important inu800 acquiring au800 more comprehensive understanding ofu800 theu800 subject matter. additionally itu800 isu800 important that anu800 interviewer asku800 clarifying questions when they areu800 confused. ifu800 theu800

theu800 responses obtained asu800 they discourage participants from using their ownu800 language tou800 express their sentiments. thus itu800 isu800 preferable that interviewers asku800 open-ended questions instead. foru800 example instead ofu800 asking u8e2809cdid theu800 experience make youu800 feel sadu800 u8e2809d - which isu800 leading inu800 nature - itu800 would beu800 better tou800

throughout theu800 entire interview - thus interviewers should avoid interrupting participants whenever possible. while participants mayu800 digress inu800 their responses andu800 while theu800

often requires theu800 participant tou800 divulge personal oru800 emotional information inu800 theu800 presence ofu800 au800 complete stranger. thus many interviewers find itu800 helpful tou800 asku800 theu800 participant tou800 address them asu800 ifu800 they were u8e2809csomeone else u8e2809d such asu800 au800 close friend oru800 family member. this isu800 often anu800 effective method foru800 tuning into theu800 aforementioned u8e2809cinner voiceu8e2809d ofu800 theu800 participant andu800 breaking down theu800 more presentational barriers ofu800 theu800 guarded u8e2809coutter

research method tou800 useu800 qualitative interviewing hasu800 many advantages. possibly theu800 greatest advantage ofu800 qualitative interviewing isu800 theu800 depth ofu800 detail from theu800

theu800 interview theu800 process ofu800 coding begins andu800 with this comes itsu800 ownu800 setu800 ofu800 disadvantages. first coding canu800 beu800 extremely time consuming. this process typically requires multiple people which canu800 also become expensive. second theu800 nature ofu800 qualitative research itself doesnu8e28099t lend itself very well tou800 quantitative analysis. some

oru800 exploitation. seidman irving. interviewing asu800 qualitative research au800 guide foru800 researchers inu800 education andu800 theu800 social sciences. teachers college press 1998 this canu800 beu800 especially true foru800 situations inu800 which au800 superior interviews au800 subordinate like when teacher interviewers hisu800 oru800 heru800 student. inu800 these situations participants mayu800 beu800 fearful ofu800 providing au800 u8e2809cwrong answer u8e2809d oru800 saying something that could potentially getu800 them into trouble andu800 reflect onu800 them negatively. however allu800 interview relationships notu800 just explicitly superior-subordinate ones areu800 marked byu800 some degree ofu800 inequality asu800 interviewers andu800 participants want andu800 receive different things from theu800 technique. thus researchers should always beu800 concerned with theu800 potential foru800 participant feelings ofu800 vulnerability especially inu800 situations where personal information isu800 revealed. inu800 order tou800 combat such feelings ofu800 vulnerability andu800 inequity andu800 tou800 make participants feel safe equal andu800 respected researchers should provide them with information about theu800 study such asu800 whou800 isu800 running itu800 andu800 what potential risks itu800 might entail andu800 also with information about their rights such asu800 theu800 right tou800 review interview materials andu800 withdraw from theu800 process atu800 anyu800 time. itu800 isu800 especially important that researchers always emphasize theu800 voluntary nature ofu800 participating inu800 au800 study sou800 that theu800 participants remain aware ofu800 their agency. these aforementioned power dynamics present inu800 interviews canu800 also have specific effects onu800 different social groups according tou800 racial background gender ageu800 andu800 class. race foru800 example canu800 pose issues inu800 anu800 interview setting ifu800 participants ofu800 au800 marginalized racial background areu800 interviewed byu800 white researchers inu800 which case theu800 existence ofu800 historical andu800 societal prejudices canu800 evoke au800 sense ofu800 skepticism andu800 distrust. gender dynamics canu800 similarly affect feelings with menu800 sometimes acting overbearingly when interviewing women andu800 acting dismissively when being interviewed byu800 women andu800 same-gendered pairs being vulnerable tou800 false assumptions ofu800 commonality oru800 au800 sense ofu800 implicit competition. inu800 terms ofu800 class participants ofu800 perceived lower status demonstrate inu800 some cases either excessive skepticism oru800 excessive submissiveness andu800 inu800 terms ofu800 ageu800 children andu800 seniors mayu800 exhibit fears ofu800 being patronized. inu800 order tou800 minimize these social group related negative feelings researchers should remain sensitive tou800 possible sources ofu800 such tensions andu800 actu800 accordingly byu800 emphasizing good manners respect andu800 au800 genuine interest inu800 theu800 participant allu800 ofu800 which canu800 allu800 help bridge social barriers. finally another aspect ofu800 interviews that canu800 affect howu800 au800 participant feels isu800 howu800 theu800 interviewer expresses hisu800 oru800 heru800 ownu800 feelings foru800 interviewers canu800 project their moods andu800 emotions onto those they areu800 interviewing. foru800 instance ifu800 anu800 interviewer feels noticeably uncomfortable theu800 participant mayu800 begin tou800
