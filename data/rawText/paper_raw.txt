1840s andu800 itu800 wasu800 theu800 dominant process before theu800 second world waru800. theu800 kraft process invented inu800 theu800 1870s andu800 first used inu800 theu800 1890s isu800 nowu800 theu800 most commonly practiced strategy. oneu800 advantage isu800 au800 chemical reaction with lignin produces heat which canu800 beu800 used tou800 runu800 au800 generator. most pulping operations

mechanical pulping mechanical pulping mechanical pulping there areu800 twou800 major mechanical pulps thermo mechanical pulp tmpu800 andu800 groundwood pulp gwu800 . inu800 theu800 tmpu800 process

debarked logs areu800 fedu800 into grinders where they areu800 pressed against rotating stones andu800 made into fibres. mechanical pulping does notu800 remove theu800 lignin sou800 theu800 yield isu800 very high 95u800 butu800 also causes paper made from this pulp tou800 yellow andu800 become brittle over time. mechanical pulps have rather short fibre lengths andu800 produce weak paper.

ownu800 waste fibre foru800 many years long before recycling become popular. preconsumer waste&nbsp;u8e28093 this isu800 offcuts andu800 processing waste such asu800 guillotine trims andu800 envelope
