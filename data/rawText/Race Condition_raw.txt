dependent onu800 theu800 sequence oru800 timing ofu800 other uncontrollable events. itu800 becomes au800 software bugu800 bugu800 when events donu800'tu800 happen inu800 theu800 order that theu800 programmer intended. theu800 term originates with theu800 idea ofu800 twou800 signal information theory signals racing each other tou800 influence theu800 output first. race conditions canu800 occur inu800 electronics systems especially logic gate logic circuits andu800 inu800 computer software especially thread computer science multithreaded oru800 distributed systems distributed programs. electronics electronics electronics au800 typical example ofu800 au800 race condition mayu800 occur inu800 au800 system ofu800 logic gate gates where inputs vary. ifu800 au800 particular output depends onu800 theu800 state ofu800 theu800 inputs itu800 mayu800 only beu800 defined foru800 steady-state signals. asu800 theu800 inputs change state au800 small delay will occur before theu800 output changes dueu800 tou800 theu800 physical nature ofu800 theu800 electronic system. foru800 au800 brief period theu800 output mayu800 change tou800 anu800 unwanted state before settling back tou800 theu800 designed state. certain systems canu800 tolerate such   glitch glitches  butu800 ifu800 foru800 example this output functions asu800 au800 clock signal foru800 further systems that contain memory theu800 system canu800 rapidly depart from itsu800 designed behaviour inu800 effect theu800 temporary glitch becomes au800 permanent glitch . foru800 example consider au800 twou800

should never beu800 true. however ifu800 changes inu800 theu800 value ofu800 au800 take longer tou800 propagate tou800 theu800 second input than theu800 first when au800 changes from false tou800 true au800 brief period will ensue during which both inputs areu800 true andu800 sou800 theu800 gate gate'su800 output will also beu800 true. cite journal first su800u82ehu800. last unger title hazards

foru800 circuit designers. critical andu800 nonu800-critical race conditions critical andu800 nonu800-critical race conditions critical andu800 nonu800-critical race conditions au800  critical race  occurs when theu800 order inu800 which internal variables areu800 changed determines theu800 eventual state that theu800 finite state machine state machine will endu800 upu800 inu800. au800  nonu800-critical race  occurs when theu800 order inu800 which internal variables areu800 changed does notu800 alter theu800 eventual state. inu800 other words au800 nonu800-critical race occurs when moving tou800 au800 desired state means that more than oneu800 internal state variable must beu800 changed atu800 once butu800 nou800 matter inu800 what order these internal state variables change theu800 resultant state will beu800 theu800 same. static dynamic andu800 essential race conditions static dynamic andu800 essential race conditions static dynamic andu800 essential race conditions ;static race conditions these areu800 caused when au800 signal andu800 itsu800 complement areu800 combined together. ;dynamic race conditions these result inu800 multiple transitions when only oneu800

conditions these areu800 caused when anu800 input hasu800 twou800 transitions inu800 less than theu800 total feedback propagation time. sometimes they areu800 cured using inductive digital delay line delay-line elements tou800 effectively increase theu800 time duration ofu800 anu800 input signal. software software software race conditions arise inu800 software when anu800 application depends onu800 theu800 sequence oru800 timing ofu800 process computer science processes oru800 thread computer science threads foru800 itu800 tou800 operate properly. asu800 with electronics there areu800 critical race conditions that result inu800 invalid execution andu800 software bugu800 bugs asu800 well asu800 nonu800-critical race-conditions that result inu800 unanticipated behavior. critical race conditions often happen when theu800 processes oru800 threads depend onu800 some shared state. operations upon shared states areu800 critical section sections that must beu800 mutually exclusive . failure tou800 obey this rule opens upu800 theu800 possibility ofu800 corrupting theu800 shared state. race conditions have au800 reputation ofu800 being difficult tou800 reproduce andu800 debug since theu800 endu800 result isu800 nondeterministic andu800 highly dependent onu800 theu800 relative timing between interfering threads. problems occurring inu800 production systems canu800 therefore disappear when running inu800 debug mode when additional logging isu800 added oru800 when attaching au800 debugger often referred tou800 asu800 au800 heisenbug . itu800 isu800 therefore better tou800 avoid race conditions byu800 careful software design rather than attempting tou800 fixu800 them afterwards. example example example asu800 au800 simple example letu800 usu800 assume that twou800 threads each want tou800 increment theu800 value ofu800 au800 global integer variable byu800 oneu800. ideally theu800 following sequence ofu800 operations would take place class wikitable style text-align center; - thread 1u800 thread 2u800 integer value - 0u800 - read value u8e28690 0u800 - style background wheat; increase value 0u800 - write back u8e28692 1u800 - read value u8e28690 1u800 - style background wheat; increase value 1u800 - write back u8e28692 2u800 inu800 theu800 case shown above theu800 final value isu800 2u800 asu800 expected. however ifu800 theu800 twou800 threads runu800 simultaneously without locking oru800 synchronization theu800 outcome ofu800 theu800 operation could beu800 wrong. theu800 alternative sequence ofu800 operations below demonstrates this scenario class wikitable style text-align center; - thread 1u800 thread 2u800 integer value - 0u800 - read value u8e28690 0u800 - read value u8e28690 0u800 - style background wheat; increase value 0u800 - style background wheat; increase value 0u800 - write back u8e28692 1u800 - write back u8e28692 1u800 theu800 final value isu800 1u800 instead ofu800 theu800 expected result ofu800 2u800. this occurs because theu800 increment operations ofu800 theu800 second case areu800 notu800 mutually exclusive. mutually exclusive operations areu800 those that cannot beu800 interrupted while accessing some resource such asu800 au800 memory location. cu800 cu800 cu800 cu800 11u800 introduced formal support foru800 multithreading andu800 defined au800  data race  strictly asu800 au800 race condition between nonu800-atomic variables. while race conditions inu800 general will continue tou800 exist au800 data race must beu800 avoided byu800 theu800 programmer whou800 must assure that only oneu800 thread atu800 au800 time mayu800 access anyu800 variable ifu800 theu800 access isu800 foru800 writing. file systems file systems file systems inu800 file system systems twou800 oru800 more programs mayu800 collide inu800 their attempts tou800 modify oru800 access au800 file which could result inu800 data corruption. file locking provides au800 commonly used solution. au800 more cumbersome remedy involves organizing theu800 system inu800 such au800 wayu800 that oneu800 unique process running au800 daemon computer software daemon oru800 theu800 like hasu800 exclusive access tou800 theu800 file andu800 allu800 other processes that need tou800 access theu800 data inu800 that file dou800 sou800 only viau800 interprocess communication with that oneu800 process which ofu800 course requires synchronization atu800 theu800 process level . au800 different form ofu800 race condition exists inu800 file systems where unrelated programs mayu800 affect each other byu800 suddenly using upu800 available resources such asu800 disk space oru800 memory oru800 processor cycles . software notu800 carefully designed tou800 anticipate andu800 handle this race situation mayu800 then become quite fragile andu800 unpredictable. such au800 risk mayu800 beu800 overlooked foru800 au800 long time inu800 au800 system that seems very reliable. butu800 eventually enough data mayu800 accumulate oru800 enough other software mayu800 beu800 added tou800 critically destabilize many parts ofu800 au800 system. probably theu800 best known example ofu800 this occurred with theu800 near-loss ofu800 theu800 spirit rover mars rover spirit notu800 long after landing butu800 this isu800 au800 commonly overlooked hazard inu800 many computer systems. au800 solution isu800 foru800 software tou800 request  andu800 reserve  allu800 theu800 resources itu800 will need before beginning au800 task; ifu800 this request fails then theu800 task isu800 postponed avoiding theu800 many points where failure could have occurred. alternatively each ofu800 those points canu800 beu800 equipped with error handling oru800 theu800 success ofu800 theu800 entire task canu800 beu800 verified afterwards before continuing. au800 more common butu800 incorrect approach isu800 tou800 simply verify that enough disk space foru800 example isu800 available before starting au800 task; this isu800 notu800 adequate because inu800 complex systems theu800 actions ofu800 other running programs canu800 beu800 unpredictable. networking networking networking inu800 networking consider au800 distributed chat network like ircu800 where au800 user whou800 starts au800 channel automatically acquires channel-operator privileges. ifu800 twou800 users onu800 different servers onu800 different ends ofu800 theu800 same network tryu800 tou800 start theu800 same-named channel atu800 theu800 same time each user user'su800 respective server will grant channel-operator privileges tou800 each user since neither server will yetu800 have received theu800 other server server'su800 signal that itu800 hasu800 allocated that channel. note that this problem hasu800 been largely internet relay chat#abuse prevention solved byu800 various ircu800 server implementations. inu800 this case ofu800 au800 race condition theu800 concept ofu800 theu800 shared resource computer science resource covers theu800 state ofu800 theu800 network what channels exist asu800 well asu800 what users started them andu800 therefore have what privileges which each server canu800 freely change asu800 long asu800 itu800 signals theu800 other servers onu800 theu800 network about theu800 changes sou800 that they canu800 update their conception ofu800 theu800 state ofu800 theu800 network. however theu800 latency engineering latency across theu800 network makes possible theu800 kind ofu800 race condition described. inu800 this case heading offu800 race conditions byu800 imposing au800 form ofu800 control over access tou800 theu800
