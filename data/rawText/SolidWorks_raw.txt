approach. solidworks isu800 au800 parasolid -based solid modeling solid modeler andu800 utilizes au800 parametric feature based modeler parametric feature-based approach tou800 create models andu800 assemblies.  parameters  refer tou800 constraints whose values determine theu800 shape oru800 geometry ofu800 theu800 model oru800 assembly. parameters canu800 beu800 either numeric parameters such asu800 line lengths oru800 circle diameters oru800 geometric parameters such asu800 tangent parallel concentric horizontal oru800 vertical etcu800. numeric parameters canu800 beu800 associated with each other through theu800 useu800 ofu800 relations which allows them tou800 capture design intent.  design intent  isu800 howu800 theu800 creator ofu800 theu800 part wants itu800 tou800 respond tou800 changes andu800 updates. foru800 example youu800 would want theu800 hole atu800 theu800 topu800 ofu800 au800 beverage canu800 tou800 stay atu800 theu800 topu800 surface regardless ofu800 theu800 height oru800 size ofu800 theu800 canu800. solidworks allows theu800 user tou800 specify that theu800 hole isu800 au800 feature onu800 theu800 topu800 surface andu800 will then honor their design intent nou800 matter what height they later assign tou800 theu800 canu800.  features  refer tou800 theu800 building blocks ofu800 theu800 part. they areu800 theu800 shapes andu800 operations that construct theu800 part. shape-based features typically begin with au800 2du800 oru800 3du800 sketch ofu800 shapes such asu800 bosses holes slots etcu800. this shape isu800 then extruded oru800 cutu800 tou800 addu800 oru800 remove material from theu800 part. operation-based features areu800 notu800 sketch-based andu800 include features such asu800 fillets chamfers shells applying draft tou800 theu800 faces ofu800 au800 part etcu800. sw03 thumb left screen shot captured from au800 solidworks topu800-down design approach. building au800 model inu800 solidworks usually starts with au800 2du800 sketch although 3du800 sketches areu800 available foru800 power user users . theu800 sketch consists ofu800 geometry such asu800 points lines arcs conics except theu800 hyperbola andu800 splines. dimensions areu800 added tou800 theu800 sketch tou800 define theu800 size andu800 location ofu800 theu800 geometry. relations areu800 used tou800 define attributes such asu800 tangency parallelism perpendicularity andu800 concentricity. theu800 parametric nature ofu800 solidworks means that theu800 dimensions andu800 relations drive theu800 geometry notu800 theu800 other wayu800 around. theu800 dimensions inu800 theu800 sketch canu800 beu800 controlled independently oru800 byu800 relationships tou800 other parameters inside oru800 outside ofu800 theu800 sketch. inu800 anu800 assembly theu800 analog tou800 sketch relations areu800 mates. just asu800 sketch relations define conditions such asu800 tangency parallelism andu800 concentricity with respect tou800 sketch geometry  assembly mates  define equivalent relations with respect tou800 theu800 individual parts oru800 components allowing theu800 easy construction ofu800 assemblies. solidworks also includes additional advanced mating features such asu800 gear andu800 camu800 follower mates which allow modeled gear assemblies tou800 accurately reproduce theu800 rotational movement ofu800 anu800 actual gear train. finally drawings canu800 beu800 created either from parts oru800 assemblies. views areu800 automatically generated from theu800 solid model andu800 notes dimensions andu800 tolerances canu800 then
