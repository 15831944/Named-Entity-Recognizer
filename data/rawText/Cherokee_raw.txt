account byu800 cherokee elders ofu800 au800 traditional twou800-part societal structure. au800 white organization ofu800 elders represented theu800 seven clans. asu800 payne recounted this group which

historians believe theu800 decline inu800 priestly power originated with au800 revolt byu800 theu800 cherokee against theu800 abuses ofu800 theu800 priestly class known asu800 theu800   aniu800-kutani
