role ofu800 endu800 users system implementation generally benefits from high levels ofu800 user involvement andu800 management support. user participation inu800 theu800 design andu800 operation ofu800 information systems hasu800 several positive results. first ifu800 users areu800 heavily involved inu800 systems design they move opportunities tou800 mold theu800 system according tou800 their priorities andu800 business requirements andu800 more opportunities tou800 control theu800 outcome. second they areu800 more likely tou800 react positively tou800 theu800 change process. incorporating user knowledge andu800 expertise leads tou800 better solutions. theu800 relationship between users andu800 information systems specialists hasu800 traditionally been au800 problem area foru800 information systems implementation efforts. users andu800 information systems specialists tend tou800 have different backgrounds interests andu800 priorities. this isu800 referred tou800 asu800
