ofu800 roles oru800 expected behaviors. theu800 social function ofu800 theu800 institution wasu800 executed byu800 theu800 fulfillment ofu800 roles. basic biological requirements foru800 reproduction

oppressive andu800 obsolete patriarchy . theu800 marxist view which sees human nature asu800 dialectic materialism historically 'evolving' towards voluntary social cooperation shared byu800 some anarchism anarchist anarchists isu800 that supraindividual institutions such asu800 theu800 market andu800 theu800 state areu800 incompatible with theu800 individual liberty which would obtain inu800 au800 truly free society. economics inu800 recent years hasu800 used game theory tou800 study institutions from twou800 perspectives. firstly howu800 dou800 institutions survive andu800 evolve inu800 this perspective institutions arise from nash equilibrium nash equilibria ofu800 games. foru800 example whenever people pass each other inu800 au800 corridor oru800 thoroughfare there isu800 au800 need foru800 customs which avoid collisions. such au800 custom might call foru800 each party tou800 keep tou800 their ownu800 right oru800 leftu8e28094such au800 choice isu800 arbitrary itu800 isu800 only necessary that theu800 choice beu800 uniform andu800 consistent . such customs mayu800 beu800 supposed tou800 beu800 theu800 origin ofu800 rules such asu800 theu800 rule adopted inu800 many countries which requires driving automobiles onu800 theu800 right side ofu800 theu800 road. secondly howu800 dou800 institutions affect behaviour inu800 this perspective theu800 focus isu800 onu800 behaviour arising from au800 given setu800 ofu800 institutional rules. inu800 these models institutions determine theu800 rules iu800u82eeu800. strategy sets andu800 utility functions ofu800 games rather than arise asu800 equilibria outu800 ofu800 games. foru800 example theu800 cournot duopoly model isu800 based onu800 anu800 institution involving anu800 auctioneer whou800 sells allu800 goods atu800 theu800 market-clearing price. while itu800 isu800 always possible tou800 analyse behaviour with theu800 institutions-asu800-equilibria approach instead itu800 isu800 much more complicated. inu800 political science theu800 effect ofu800 institutions onu800 behavior hasu800 also been considered from au800 meme perspective like game theory borrowed from biology. au800 memetic institutionalism hasu800 been proposed suggesting that institutions provide selection environments foru800 political action whereby differentiated retention arises andu800 thereby au800 darwinian evolution ofu800 institutions over time. public choice theory another branch ofu800 economics with au800 close relationship tou800 political science considers howu800 government policy choices areu800 made andu800 seeks tou800 determine what theu800 policy outcomes areu800 likely tou800 beu800 given au800 particular political decision-making process andu800 context. inu800 history au800 distinction between eras oru800 periods implies au800 major andu800 fundamental change inu800 theu800 system ofu800 institutions governing au800 society. political andu800 military events areu800 judged tou800 beu800 ofu800 historical significance tou800 theu800 extent that they areu800 associated with changes inu800 institutions. inu800 european history particular significance isu800 attached tou800 theu800 long transition from theu800 feudalism feudal institutions ofu800 theu800 middle ages tou800 theu800 modern world modern institutions which govern contemporary life. institutionalization institutionalization institutionalization main institutionalisation theu800 term institutionalization isu800 widely used inu800 social theory tou800 refer tou800 theu800 process ofu800 embedding
