paper andu800 there areu800 three types ofu800 finish that theu800 paper canu800 have. theu800 first isu800  machine  finish andu800 canu800 range from au800 rough antique look tou800 au800 smooth high quality finish. theu800 second isu800 called au800 supercalendered finish andu800 isu800 au800 higher degree foru800 fine-screened halftone printing. theu800 third type ofu800 finish isu800 called au800  plater  finish andu800 whereas theu800 first twou800 types ofu800 finish areu800 accomplished byu800 theu800 calender stack itself au800 plater finish isu800 obtained byu800 placing cutu800 sheets ofu800 paper between zinc oru800 copper plates that areu800 stacked together then putu800 under pressure andu800 heating. au800 special finish such asu800 au800  linen  finish would beu800 achieved byu800 placing au800 piece ofu800 linen between theu800 plate andu800 theu800 sheet ofu800 paper oru800 else anu800 embossed steel roll might beu800 used. after calendering theu800

oru800 pressed between polished metal sheets inu800 au800 press. with theu800 continuously operating paper machine itu800 became part ofu800 theu800 process ofu800 rolling theu800 paper inu800 this case also called webu800 paper . theu800 pressure between theu800 rollers theu800 nipu800 pressure canu800 beu800 reduced byu800 heating theu800 rolls andu800 oru800 moistening theu800 paper surface. this helps tou800 keep theu800 bulk andu800 theu800 stiffness ofu800 theu800 webu800 paper which isu800 beneficial foru800 itsu800 later useu800. modern calenders have hard heated rollers made from chilled cast iron oru800 steel andu800 soft rollers coated with polymeric composites. this widens theu800 working nipu800 andu800 distributes theu800 specific pressure onu800 theu800 paper more evenly. supercalender supercalender supercalender au800  supercalender  -- note this isu800 theu800 correct spelling ofu800 calender when used inu800 this sense. -- isu800 au800 stack ofu800 calenders

except that alternate chilled cast iron andu800 softer rolls areu800 used. theu800 rolls used tou800 supercalender uncoated paper usually consist ofu800 cast iron andu800 highly compressed paper while theu800 rolls used foru800 coated paper areu800 usually cast iron andu800 highly compressed cotton. theu800 finish produced varies according tou800 theu800 rawu800 material used tou800 make theu800

containing fine line blocks oru800 halftone halftones because they print well from type andu800 halftones although foru800 theu800 latter they areu800 notu800 asu800 good asu800 coated paper. other
