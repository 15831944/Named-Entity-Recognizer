theu800 term demand signifies theu800 ability oru800 theu800 willingness tou800 buyu800 au800 particular commodity atu800 au800 given point ofu800 time. introduction introduction introduction economists record demand onu800 au800 demand schedule andu800 plot itu800 onu800 au800 graph asu800 au800 demand curve that isu800 usually downward sloping. theu800 downward slope reflects theu800 negative oru800 inverse relationship between price andu800 quantity demanded asu800 price decreases quantity demanded increases. inu800 principle each consumer hasu800 au800 demand curve foru800 anyu800 product that heu800 oru800 sheu800 isu800 willing andu800 able tou800 buyu800 andu800 theu800 consumer consumer'su800 demand curve isu800 equal tou800 theu800 marginal utility benefit curve. when theu800 demand curves ofu800 allu800 consumers areu800 added upu800 horizontally theu800 result isu800 theu800 market demand curve foru800 that product which also indicates au800 negative oru800 inverse relationship between theu800 price andu800 quantity demanded. ifu800 there areu800 nou800 externalities theu800 market demand curve isu800 also equal tou800 theu800 social utility benefit curve. factors affecting demand factors affecting demand factors affecting demand innumerable factors andu800 circumstances could affect au800 buyer buyer'su800 willingness oru800 ability tou800 buyu800 au800 good. some ofu800 theu800 more common factors areu800  good  good'su800 ownu800 price  theu800 basic demand relationship isu800 between potential prices ofu800 au800 good andu800 theu800 quantities that would beu800 purchased atu800 those prices. generally theu800 relationship isu800 negative meaning that anu800 increase inu800 price will induce au800 decrease inu800 theu800 quantity demanded. this negative relationship isu800 embodied inu800 theu800 downward slope ofu800 theu800 consumer demand curve. theu800 assumption ofu800 au800 negative relationship isu800 reasonable andu800 intuitive. ifu800 theu800 price ofu800 au800 newu800 novel isu800 high au800 person might decide tou800 borrow theu800 book from theu800 public library rather than buyu800 itu800.  price ofu800 related goods  theu800 principal related goods areu800 complements andu800 substitutes. au800 complement isu800 au800 good that isu800 used with theu800 primary good. examples include hotdogs andu800 mustard beer andu800 pretzels automobiles andu800 gasoline. perfect complements behave asu800 au800 single good. ifu800 theu800 price ofu800 theu800 complement goes upu800 theu800 quantity demanded ofu800 theu800 other good goes down. mathematically theu800 variable representing theu800 price ofu800 theu800 complementary good would have au800 negative coefficient inu800 theu800 demand function. foru800 example qu800 du800 au800 - pu800 - pu800 gu800 where qu800 isu800 theu800 quantity ofu800 automobiles demanded pu800 isu800 theu800 price ofu800 automobiles andu800 pu800 gu800 isu800 theu800 price ofu800 gasoline. theu800 other main category ofu800 related goods areu800 substitutes. substitutes areu800 goods that canu800 beu800 used inu800 place ofu800 theu800 primary good. theu800 mathematical relationship between theu800 price ofu800 theu800 substitute andu800 theu800 demand foru800 theu800 good inu800 question isu800 positive. ifu800 theu800 price ofu800 theu800 substitute goes down theu800 demand foru800 theu800 good inu800 question goes down.  personal disposable income  inu800 most cases theu800 more disposable income income after taxu800 andu800 receipt ofu800 benefits au800 person hasu800 theu800 more likely that person isu800 tou800 buyu800.  tastes oru800 preferences  theu800 greater theu800 desire tou800 ownu800 au800 good theu800 more likely oneu800 isu800 tou800 buyu800 theu800 good there isu800 au800 basic distinction between desire andu800 demand. desire isu800 au800 measure ofu800 theu800 willingness tou800 buyu800 au800 good based onu800 itsu800 intrinsic qualities. demand isu800 theu800 willingness andu800 ability tou800 putu800 oneu800 oneu800'su800 desires into effect. itu800 isu800 assumed that tastes andu800 preferences areu800 relatively constant.  consumer expectations about future prices andu800 income  ifu800 au800 consumer believes that theu800 price ofu800 theu800 good will beu800 higher inu800 theu800 future heu800 isu800 more likely tou800 purchase theu800 good nowu800. ifu800 theu800 consumer expects that hisu800 income will beu800 higher inu800 theu800 future theu800 consumer mayu800 buyu800 theu800 good nowu800.  population  ifu800 theu800 population grows this means that demand will also increase.  nature ofu800 theu800 good  ifu800 theu800 good isu800 au800 basic commodity itu800 will lead tou800 au800 higher demand this list isu800 notu800 exhaustive. allu800 facts andu800 circumstances that au800 buyer finds relevant tou800 hisu800 willingness oru800 ability tou800 buyu800 goods canu800 affect demand. foru800 example au800 person caught inu800 anu800 unexpected storm isu800 more likely tou800 buyu800 anu800 umbrella than ifu800 theu800 weather were bright andu800 sunny. demand

asu800 theu800 consumer consumer'su800 income increased. specifying values foru800 theu800 nonu800 price determinants prgu800 4u800u82e00u800 andu800 yu800 50u800 results inu800 theu800 demand

146u800-47u800. this isu800 theu800 substitution effect. when theu800 relative price ofu800 au800 good falls theu800 consumer canu800 buyu800 theu800 same bundle ofu800 goods asu800 before theu800 price decline andu800 have some money left over. this money canu800 beu800 used tou800 purchase more ofu800 allu800 hisu800 consumption goods. inu800 other words hisu800 purchasing power isu800 called theu800 income effect. discrete goods discrete goods discrete goods inu800 some cases itu800 isu800 impractical tou800 represent theu800 relationship between price andu800 demand with au800 continuous curve because ofu800 small quantities demanded. goods andu800 services measured inu800 small units areu800 best represented with au800 smooth curve. examples include food measured inu800 calories andu800 leisure measured inu800 minutes. however when theu800 price ofu800 au800 good isu800 very high inu800 proportion tou800 au800 consumer consumer'su800 budget there isu800 au800 need tou800 incorporate this limitation inu800 both theu800 mathematical analysis andu800 theu800 graph representing theu800 relationship. while cars andu800 houses areu800 discrete goods foru800 most people cheaper goods such asu800 glasses andu800 bicycles areu800 discrete goods only foru800 theu800 poverty threshold very poor . onu800 theu800 national level nuclear power plants oru800 space stations mayu800 beu800 considered discrete goods. theu800 concept isu800 more useful atu800 theu800 individual consumer consumer'su800 level than atu800 theu800 consumers aggregate level because foru800 example theu800 difference between 3u800 000u800 000u800 cars demanded andu800 3u800 000u800 001u800 cars demanded isu800 sou800 little that theu800 market demand foru800 cars canu800 beu800 viewed
