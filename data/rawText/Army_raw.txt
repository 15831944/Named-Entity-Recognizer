thus theu800 scutage wasu800 introduced whereby most englishmen paid tou800 escape their service andu800 this money wasu800 used tou800 create au800 permanent army. however almost allu800 high

bulk ofu800 theu800 renaissance armies wasu800 composed ofu800 mercenaries. first nation-states lacked theu800 funds needed tou800 maintain standing forces sou800 they tended tou800 hire mercenaries tou800 serve inu800 their armies during wartime. such mercenaries typically formed atu800 theu800 ends ofu800 periods ofu800 conflict when menu800-atu800-arms were nou800 longer needed byu800 their

theu800 combination ofu800 increased taxes andu800 increased centralisation ofu800 government functions caused au800 series ofu800 revolts across europe such asu800 theu800 fronde inu800 france
