could apply tou800 many other plains tribes. theu800 specific traits ofu800 these groups dou800 notu800 seem particularly apachean. additionally harry hoijer 'su800 classification ofu800 plains apache asu800 anu800 apachean language hasu800 been disputed. when theu800 spanish arrived inu800 theu800 area trade between theu800 long established pueblo peoples andu800 theu800 southern athabaskan wasu800 well established. they reported theu800 pueblo exchanged maize andu800 woven cotton goods foru800 bison meat andu800 hides andu800 materials foru800 stone tools. coronado observed theu800 plains people wintering near theu800 pueblo inu800 established camps. later spanish sovereignty over theu800 area disrupted trade between theu800 pueblo andu800 theu800 diverging apache andu800 navajo groups. theu800 apache quickly acquired horses improving their mobility foru800 quick raids onu800 settlements. inu800 addition theu800 pueblo were forced tou800 work spanish mission lands andu800

uninhabited although some scholars have argued that heu800 simply didu800 notu800 seeu800 theu800 american indians. other spanish explorers first mention querechos living west ofu800 theu800 riou800 grande inu800 theu800 1580s. tou800 some historians this implies theu800 apaches moved into their current southwestern homelands inu800 theu800 late 16th andu800 early 17th centuries. other historians note that coronado reported that pueblo women andu800 children hadu800 often been evacuated byu800 theu800 time hisu800 party attacked their dwellings andu800 that heu800 sawu800 some dwellings hadu800 been recently abandoned asu800 heu800 moved upu800 theu800 riou800 grande. this might indicate theu800 semi-nomadic southern athabaskan hadu800 advance warning about hisu800 hostile approach andu800 evaded encounter with theu800 spanish. archaeologists areu800 finding ample evidence ofu800 anu800 early proto-apache presence inu800 theu800 southwestern mountain zone inu800 theu800 15th century andu800 perhaps earlier. theu800 apache presence onu800 both theu800 plains andu800 inu800 theu800 mountainous southwest indicate that theu800 people took multiple early migration routes.
