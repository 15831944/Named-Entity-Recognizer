'master' database holds critical system related information that includes logins passwords andu800 dataserver configuration parameters. 'tempdb' isu800 used foru800 storage ofu800 data that areu800 required foru800 intermediate processing ofu800 queries andu800 temporary data. 'model' isu800 used au800 template foru800 creating newu800 databases.
