beu800 caused byu800 loss ofu800 support dueu800 tou800 voids beneath theu800 concrete pavement slabs. theu800 voids usually occur near cracks oru800 joints dueu800 tou800 surface water infiltration. theu800 most common causes ofu800 voids areu800 pumping consolidation subgrade failure andu800 bridge approach failure. slab stabilization isu800 au800 nonu800-destructive method ofu800 solving this problem andu800 isu800 usually employed with other concrete pavement restoration international grooving & grinding association cpru800 methods including patching andu800 diamond grinding. theu800 technique restores support tou800 concrete slabs byu800 filing small voids that develop underneath theu800 concrete slab atu800 joints cracks oru800 theu800 pavement edge. theu800 process consists ofu800 pumping au800 cementitous grout oru800 polyurethane mixture through holes drilled through theu800 slab. theu800 grout canu800 fill small voids beneath theu800 slab andu800 oru800 subu800-base. theu800 grout also displaces free water andu800 helps keep water from saturating andu800 weakening support under theu800 joints andu800 slab edge after stabilization isu800 complete. theu800 three steps foru800 this method after finding theu800 voids areu800 locating andu800 drilling holes grout injection andu800 post-testing theu800 stabilized slabs. slab stabilization does notu800 correct depressions increase theu800 design structural capacity stop erosion oru800 eliminate faulting. itu800 does however restore theu800 slab support therefore decreasing deflections under theu800 load. stabilization should only beu800 performed atu800 joints andu800 cracks where loss ofu800 support exists. visual inspection isu800 theu800 simplest manner tou800 find voids. signs that repair isu800 needed areu800 transverse joint faulting corner breaks andu800 shoulder drop offu800 andu800 lines atu800 oru800 near joints andu800 cracks. deflection testing isu800 another common procedure utilized

atu800 their highest. testing testing testing ground penetrating radar pulses electromagnetic waves into theu800 pavement andu800 measures andu800 graphically displays theu800 reflected signal. this canu800 reveal voids andu800 other defects. theu800 epoxy core test detects voids byu800 visual andu800 mechanical methods. itu800 consists ofu800 drilling au800 25u800 tou800 50u800 millimeter hole through theu800 pavement into theu800 subu800-base with au800 dryu800-bitu800 roto-hammer. next au800 twou800-part epoxy isu800 poured into theu800 hole&mdash;dyed foru800 visual clarity. once theu800 epoxy hardens technicians drill through theu800 hole. ifu800 au800 void isu800 present theu800 epoxy will stick tou800 theu800 core andu800 provide physical evidence. common stabilization materials include pozzolan-cement grout andu800 polyurethane. theu800 requirements foru800 slab stabilization areu800 strength andu800 theu800 ability tou800 flow into oru800 expand tou800 fill small voids.
