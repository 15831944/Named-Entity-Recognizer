coordinates that identify au800 point inu800 physical space. coordinates used canu800 vary depending onu800 theu800 application. foru800 navigation terrestrial navigation these coordinates canu800 include longitude andu800 latitude . airu800 navigation also includes altitude . waypoints have only become widespread foru800 navigational useu800 byu800 theu800 layman since theu800 development ofu800 advanced navigational systems such asu800 theu800 global positioning system gpsu800 andu800 certain other types ofu800 radio navigation. waypoints located onu800 theu800 surface ofu800 theu800 earth areu800 usually defined inu800 twou800 dimensions  eu800u82egu800.   longitude andu800 latitude ; those used inu800 theu800 earth earth'su800 atmosphere oru800 inu800 outer space areu800 defined inu800 atu800 least three dimensions four ifu800 time isu800 oneu800 ofu800 theu800 coordinates asu800 itu800 might beu800 foru800 some waypoints outside theu800 earth . although theu800 term  waypoint  hasu800 only come into common useu800 inu800 recent years theu800 equivalent ofu800 au800 waypoint inu800 allu800 butu800 name hasu800 existed foru800 asu800 long asu800 human beings have navigated. waypoints have traditionally been associated with distinctive features ofu800 theu800 real world such asu800 rock geology rock formations spring hydrosphere spring springs oasis oases mountain mountains buildings roadways waterways railways andu800 sou800 onu800. today these associations persist butu800 waypoints areu800 more often associated with physical artifacts created specifically foru800 navigation such asu800 radio beacon beacons buoy buoys satellite satellites control point orienteering control points etcu800. inu800 theu800 modern world waypoints areu800 increasingly abstract often having nou800 obvious relationship tou800 anyu800 distinctive features ofu800 theu800 real world. these waypoints areu800 used tou800 help define invisible routing paths foru800 navigation. foru800 example artificial airway aviation airways &mdash;u8e2809chighways inu800 theu800 skyu8e2809d created specifically foru800 purposes ofu800 airu800 navigation&mdash;often have nou800 clear connection tou800 features ofu800 theu800 real world andu800 consist only ofu800 au800 series ofu800 abstract waypoints inu800 theu800 skyu800 through which pilots navigate; these airways areu800 designed tou800 facilitate airu800 traffic control andu800 routing ofu800 traffic between heavily traveled locations andu800 dou800 notu800 reference natural terrain features. abstract waypoints ofu800 this kind have been made practical byu800 modern navigation technologies such asu800 land-based radio beacons andu800 theu800 satellite-based gpsu800. abstract waypoints typically have only specified longitude andu800 latitude oru800 universal transverse mercator utmu800 coordinates plus theu800 reference datum andu800 often au800 name ifu800 they areu800 marked onu800 charts andu800 areu800 located using au800 radio navigation system such asu800 au800 vhfu800 omnidirectional range voru800 oru800 gpsu800 receiver. au800 waypoint canu800 beu800 au800 destination au800 fixu800 along au800 planned course navigation course used tou800 make au800 journey oru800 simply au800 point ofu800 reference useful foru800 navigation. anchor waypoints andu800 gpsu800 with gpsu800 anchor waypoints andu800 gpsu800 with gpsu800 anchor waypoints andu800 gpsu800 with gpsu800 gpsu800 systems areu800 increasingly used tou800 create andu800 useu800 waypoints inu800 navigation ofu800 allu800 kinds. au800 typical gpsu800 receiver canu800 locate au800 waypoint with anu800 accuracy ofu800 three meters oru800 better when used with land-based assisting technologies such asu800 theu800 wide area augmentation system waas . waypoints canu800 also beu800 marked onu800 au800 computer mapping program andu800 uploaded tou800 theu800 gpsu800 receiver marked onu800 theu800 receiver receiver'su800 ownu800 internal mapu800 oru800 entered manually onu800 theu800 device asu800 au800 pair ofu800 coordinates. ifu800 theu800 gpsu800 receiver hasu800 track-logging capabilities oneu800 canu800 also define waypoints after theu800 fact from where oneu800 hasu800 been. foru800 example marine gpsu800 receivers often have au800 manu800 overboard function which instantly creates au800 waypoint inu800 theu800 receiver foru800 theu800 boat boat'su800 position when enabled andu800 then begins displaying theu800 distance andu800 course back tou800 that position. inu800 gpsu800 navigation au800 route isu800 usually defined asu800 au800 series ofu800 twou800 oru800 more waypoints. tou800 follow such au800 route theu800 gpsu800 user navigates tou800 theu800 nearest waypoint then tou800 theu800 next oneu800 inu800 turn until theu800 destination isu800 reached. most receivers have theu800 ability tou800 compute au800 great circle route towards au800 waypoint enabling them tou800 find theu800 shortest route even over long distances although waypoints areu800 often sou800 closely spaced that this isnu800'tu800 au800 factor. many gpsu800 receivers both military andu800 civilian nowu800 offer integrated cartography cartographic database databases also known asu800  base maps  allowing users tou800 locate au800 point onu800 au800 mapu800 andu800 define itu800 asu800 au800 waypoint. some gpsu800 systems intended foru800 automobile navigation canu800 generate au800 suggested driving route between twou800 waypoints based onu800 theu800 cartographic database. asu800 oneu800 drives along theu800 route theu800 system indicates theu800 driver driver'su800 current location andu800 gives advance notice ofu800 upcoming turns. theu800 best ofu800 these systems canu800 take into account traffic restrictions such asu800 oneu800-wayu800 street streets andu800 intersections where left oru800 right turns areu800 prohibited when computing theu800 suggested driving route. most gpsu800 receivers allow theu800 user tou800 assign au800 name tou800 each waypoint. many models also letu800 theu800 user select au800 symbol oru800 icon computing icon tou800 identify theu800 waypoint onu800 au800 graphical mapu800 display from au800 built-inu800 library ofu800 icons. these include standard mapu800 symbols foru800 marine navigation aids such asu800 buoys marina marinas andu800 anchorages asu800 well asu800 such land-based symbols asu800 church building church churches bridge bridges shopping centers park parks andu800 tunnel tunnels. gpsu800 receivers used inu800 airu800 navigation have databases which contain named waypoints radio navigation aids airports andu800 helo-ports. these references comprise theu800 national airspace system system'su800 method ofu800 allowing airu800 traffic tou800 select routes that yield efficient point tou800 point navigation. waypoints areu800 often used inu800 theu800 termination phase ofu800 au800 flight tou800 itsu800 destination airport. some gpsu800 receivers areu800 integrated into autopilot oru800 flight management system tou800 aidu800 theu800 pilot inu800 control ofu800 anu800 aircraft. waypoints mayu800 beu800 found onu800 aeronautical charts known asu800 ifru800 enroute charts terminal arrival procedures andu800 sectional charts. without gpsu800 without gpsu800 without gpsu800 although theu800 concept ofu800 waypoints hasu800 been greatly popularized among nonu800-specialists byu800 theu800 development ofu800 theu800 gpsu800 waypoints canu800 beu800 used with other navigational aids. au800 notable example isu800 theu800 worldwide useu800 inu800 orienteering sports ofu800 waypoints with au800 mapu800 that omits au800 coordinate system seeu800 control point orienteering . inu800 aerial

terms ofu800 specific distances andu800 headings towards oru800 away from au800 radio beacon. foru800 visual airu800 navigation seeu800 theu800 article onu800 visual flight rules waypoints mayu800
