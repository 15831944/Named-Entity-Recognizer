ofu800 only oneu800 phase matter phase . inu800 such au800 mixture au800  solute  isu800 au800 substance dissolution chemistry dissolved inu800 another substance known asu800 au800   solvent  . theu800 solvent does theu800 dissolving. theu800 solution more oru800 less takes onu800 theu800 characteristics ofu800 theu800 solvent including itsu800 phase andu800 theu800 solvent isu800 commonly theu800 major fraction ofu800 theu800 mixture. theu800 concentration ofu800 au800 solute inu800 au800 solution isu800 au800 measure ofu800 howu800 much ofu800 that solute isu800 dissolved inu800 theu800 solvent. characteristics characteristics characteristics au800 solution isu800 au800 homogeneous mixture theu800 particles ofu800 solute inu800 solution cannot beu800 seen byu800 naked eyeu800. theu800 solution does notu800 allow beam ofu800 light tou800 light scattering scatter . au800 solution isu800 stable. theu800 solute from theu800 solution cannot beu800 separated byu800 filtration oru800 mechanically . types types types  homogeneous  means that theu800 components ofu800 theu800 mixture form au800 single phase. theu800 properties ofu800 theu800 mixture such asu800 concentration temperature andu800 density canu800 beu800 uniformly distributed through theu800 volume butu800 only inu800 absence ofu800 diffusion phenomena oru800 after their completion. usually theu800 substance present inu800 theu800 greatest amount isu800 considered theu800 solvent. solvents canu800 beu800 gases liquids oru800 solids. oneu800 oru800 more components present inu800 theu800 solution other than theu800 solvent areu800 called solutes. theu800 solution hasu800 theu800 same state ofu800 matter physical state asu800 theu800 solvent. gasu800 gasu800 gasu800 ifu800 theu800

inu800 nitrogen . since interactions between molecules play almost nou800 role dilute gases form rather trivial solutions. inu800 part ofu800 theu800 literature they areu800 notu800 even classified asu800 solutions butu800 addressed asu800 mixture mixtures. liquid liquid liquid ifu800 theu800 solvent isu800 au800 liquid then gases liquids andu800 solids canu800 beu800 dissolved. here areu800 some examples gasu800 inu800 liquid oxygen inu800 water carbon dioxide inu800 water u8e28093 au800 less simple example because theu800 solution isu800 accompanied byu800 au800 chemical reaction

suspension chemistry suspension suspensions emulsion emulsions areu800 notu800 considered solutions. body fluids areu800 examples foru800 complex liquid solutions containing many solutes. many ofu800 these areu800 electrolyte electrolytes since they contain solute ions such asu800 potassium . furthermore they contain solute molecules like sugar andu800 urea . oxygen andu800 carbon dioxide areu800 also essential components ofu800 blood chemistry where significant changes inu800 their concentrations mayu800 beu800 au800 sign ofu800 severe illness oru800 injury. solid solid solid ifu800 theu800

. when au800 liquid canu800 completely dissolve inu800 another liquid theu800 twou800 liquids areu800  miscible . twou800 substances that canu800 never mixu800 tou800 form au800 solution areu800 called  immiscible . allu800 solutions have au800 positive entropy ofu800 mixing. theu800 interactions between different molecules oru800 ions mayu800 beu800 energetically favored oru800 notu800. ifu800 interactions areu800 unfavorable then theu800 thermodynamic free energy free energy decreases with increasing solute concentration. atu800 some point theu800 energy loss outweighs theu800 entropy gain andu800 nou800 more solute particles canu800 beu800 dissolved; theu800 solution isu800 said tou800 beu800 saturation chemistry saturated . however theu800 point atu800 which au800 solution canu800 become saturated canu800 change significantly with different environmental factors such asu800 temperature pressure andu800 contamination. foru800 some solute-solvent combinations au800 supersaturated solution canu800 beu800 prepared byu800 raising theu800 solubility foru800 example byu800 increasing theu800 temperature tou800 dissolve more solute andu800 then lowering itu800 foru800 example byu800 cooling . usually theu800 greater theu800 temperature ofu800 theu800 solvent theu800 more ofu800 au800 given solid solute itu800 canu800 dissolve. however most gases andu800 some compounds exhibit solubilities that decrease with increased temperature. such behavior isu800 au800 result ofu800 anu800 exothermic enthalpy ofu800 solution . some surfactant surfactants exhibit this behaviour. theu800 solubility ofu800 liquids inu800 liquids isu800 generally less temperature-sensitive than that ofu800 solids oru800 gases. properties properties properties theu800 physical properties ofu800 compounds such asu800 melting point andu800 boiling point change when other compounds areu800 added. together they areu800 called colligative properties . there areu800 several ways tou800 quantify theu800 amount ofu800 oneu800 compound dissolved inu800 theu800 other compounds collectively called concentration . examples include  molarity  mole fraction andu800  parts peru800 million  ppmu800 . theu800 properties ofu800 ideal solution solutions canu800 beu800 calculated byu800 theu800 linear combination ofu800 theu800 properties ofu800 itsu800 components. ifu800 both solute andu800 solvent exist inu800 equal quantities such asu800 inu800 au800 50u800 ethanol 50u800 water solution theu800 concepts ofu800 solute andu800 solvent become less relevant butu800 theu800 substance that isu800 more often used asu800 au800 solvent isu800 normally designated asu800 theu800 solvent inu800 this example water . liquid liquid liquid seeu800 also solvent#solvent classifications inu800 principle allu800 types ofu800 liquids canu800 behave asu800 solvents liquid noble gasu800 gases molten metals molten salts molten covalent networks andu800 molecular liquids. inu800 theu800 practice ofu800 chemistry andu800 biochemistry most solvents areu800 molecular liquids. they canu800 beu800 classified into chemical polarity polar andu800 nonu800-polar according tou800 whether their molecules possess au800 permanent electric dipole moment . another distinction isu800 whether their molecules canu800 form hydrogen bond bonds protic andu800 aprotic solvents . water theu800 most commonly used solvent isu800 both polar andu800 sustains hydrogen bonds. file 3du800 model hydrogen bonds inu800 wateru82esvgu800 right thumb 150px water isu800 au800 good solvent because theu800 molecules areu800 polar andu800 capable ofu800 forming hydrogen bonds 1u800 . salts dissolve inu800 polar solvents forming positive andu800 negative ions that areu800 attracted tou800 theu800 negative andu800 positive ends ofu800 theu800 solvent molecule respectively. ifu800 theu800 solvent isu800 water solvation hydration occurs when theu800 charged solute ions become surrounded byu800 water molecules. au800 standard example isu800 aqueous saltwater. such solutions areu800 called electrolyte electrolytes. foru800 nonu800-ionic solutes theu800 general rule isu800 like dissolves like. polar solutes dissolve inu800 polar solvents forming polar bonds oru800 hydrogen bonds. asu800 anu800 example allu800 alcoholic beverages areu800 aqueous solutions ofu800 ethanol . onu800 theu800 other hand nonu800-polar solutes dissolve better inu800 nonu800-polar solvents. examples areu800 hydrocarbons such asu800 oilu800 andu800 petroleum grease that easily mixu800 with each other while being incompatible with water. anu800 example foru800 theu800 immiscibility ofu800 oilu800 andu800 water isu800 au800 leak ofu800 petroleum from au800 damaged tanker that does notu800
