contrasting view isu800 that this perspective fails onu800 twou800 points. first theu800 perspective does notu800 recognize that theu800 user experience mayu800 beu800 supported byu800 requirements notu800 perceivable byu800 theu800 user. foru800 example au800 requirement tou800 present geocoding geocoded information tou800 theu800 user mayu800 beu800 supported byu800 au800 requirement foru800 anu800 interface with anu800 external third party business partner. theu800 interface will beu800 imperceptible tou800 theu800 user though theu800 presentation ofu800 information obtained through theu800 interface certainly would notu800. second au800 constraint limits design alternatives whereas au800 requirement specifies design characteristics. tou800 continue theu800 example au800 requirement selecting au800 webu800 service interface isu800 different from au800 constraint limiting design alternatives tou800 methods compatible with au800 single sign-onu800 architecture. verification verification verification allu800 requirements should beu800 verifiable. theu800 most common method isu800 byu800 test. ifu800 this isu800 notu800 theu800 case another verification method should beu800 used instead eu800u82egu800. analysis demonstration oru800 inspection oru800 review ofu800 design . certain requirements byu800 their very structure areu800 notu800 verifiable. these include requirements that sayu800 theu800 system must  never  oru800  always  exhibit au800 particular property. proper testing ofu800 these requirements would require anu800 infinite testing cycle. such requirements must beu800 rewritten tou800 beu800 verifiable. asu800 stated above allu800 requirements must beu800 verifiable. nonu800-functional requirements which areu800 unverifiable atu800 theu800 software level must still beu800 kept asu800 au800 documentation ofu800 customer intent. however they mayu800 beu800 traced tou800 process requirements that areu800 determined tou800 beu800
