asu800 gold iron copper silver .  biotic resources  areu800 obtained from theu800 biosphere . forests andu800 their products animals birds andu800 their products fish andu800 other marine organisms areu800 important examples. minerals such asu800 coal andu800 petroleum areu800 sometimes included inu800 this category because they were formed from fossilized organic matter though over long periods ofu800 time. natural resources areu800 also categorized based onu800 theu800 stage ofu800 development  potential resources  areu800 known tou800 exist andu800 mayu800 beu800 used inu800 theu800 future. foru800 example petroleum mayu800 exist inu800 many parts ofu800 india andu800 kuwait that have sedimentary rocks butu800 until theu800 time itu800 isu800 actually drilled outu800 andu800 putu800 into useu800 itu800 remains au800 potential resource.  actual resources  areu800 those that have been surveyed their quantity andu800 quality determined andu800 areu800 being used inu800 present times. foru800 example petroleum andu800 natural gasu800 isu800 actively being obtained from theu800 mumbai high fields. theu800 development ofu800 anu800 actual resource such asu800 wood processing depends upon theu800 technology available andu800 theu800 cost involved. that part ofu800 theu800 actual resource that canu800 beu800 developed profitably with available technology isu800 called au800  reserve resource  while that part that canu800 notu800 beu800 developed profitably because ofu800 lack ofu800 technology isu800 called au800  stock resource . natural resources canu800 beu800 categorized onu800 theu800 basis ofu800 renewability   nonu800-renewable resources nonu800-renewable resources   areu800 formed over very long geological period periods. minerals andu800 fossils areu800 included inu800 this category. since their rate ofu800 formation isu800 extremely slow they cannot beu800 replenished once they areu800 resource depletion depleted . outu800 ofu800 these theu800 metallic minerals canu800 beu800 reu800-used byu800 recycling them butu800 coal andu800 petroleum cannot beu800 recycled.   renewable resources   such asu800 forests andu800 fisheries canu800 beu800 replenished oru800 reproduced relatively quickly. theu800 highest rate atu800 which au800 resource canu800 beu800 used sustainably isu800 theu800 sustainable yield . some resources like sunlight airu800 andu800 wind areu800 called  perpetual resources  because they areu800 available continuously though atu800 au800 limited rate. their quantity isu800 notu800 affected byu800 human consumption. many renewable resources canu800 beu800 depleted byu800 human useu800 butu800 mayu800 also beu800 replenished thus maintaining au800 flow. some ofu800 these like agricultural crops take au800 short time foru800 renewal; others like water take au800 comparatively longer time while still others like forests take even longer. dependent upon theu800 speed andu800 quantity ofu800 consumption overconsumption canu800 lead tou800 depletion oru800 total andu800 everlasting destruction ofu800 au800 resource. important examples areu800 agricultural areas fish andu800 other animals forests healthy water andu800 soil cultivated andu800 natural landscapes. such  conditionally renewable resources  areu800 sometimes classified asu800 au800 third kind ofu800 resource oru800 asu800 au800 subtype ofu800 renewable resources. conditionally renewable resources areu800 presently subject tou800 excess human consumption andu800 theu800 only sustainable long term useu800 ofu800 such
