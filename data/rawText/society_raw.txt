theu800 main form ofu800 food production inu800 such societies isu800 theu800 daily collection ofu800 wild plants andu800 theu800 hunting ofu800 wild animals. hunter-gatherers move around constantly inu800 search ofu800 food. asu800 au800 result they dou800 notu800 build permanent villages oru800 create au800 wide variety ofu800 artifact archaeology artifacts andu800 usually only form small

inu800 larger groups andu800 formed complex hierarchical social structures such asu800 chiefdoms. theu800 need foru800 mobility also limits theu800 size ofu800 these societies. they generally consist ofu800 fewer than 60u800 people andu800 rarely exceed 100u800. statuses within theu800 tribe areu800 relatively equal andu800 decisions areu800 reached through general agreement. theu800 ties that

more reliable pastoral societies canu800 support larger populations. since there areu800 food surpluses fewer people areu800 needed tou800 produce food. asu800 au800 result theu800 division ofu800 labor theu800 specialization byu800 individuals oru800 groups inu800 theu800 performance ofu800 specific economic activities becomes more complex. foru800 example some people become craftworkers

families often gain power through their increased wealth . theu800 passing onu800 ofu800 property from oneu800 generation tou800 another helps tou800 centralize wealth andu800 power. over time emerge

isu800 cutu800 andu800 burned andu800 ashes areu800 used asu800 fertilizers. horticulturists useu800 human labor andu800 simple tools tou800 cultivate theu800 land foru800 oneu800 oru800 more seasons. when theu800 land becomes barren horticulturists clear au800 newu800 plot andu800 leave theu800 oldu800 plot tou800 revert tou800 itsu800 natural state. they mayu800 return tou800 theu800 original land several years later andu800 begin theu800 process again. byu800 rotating their garden plots horticulturists canu800 stay inu800 oneu800 area foru800 au800 fairly long period ofu800 time. this allows them tou800 build semipermanent oru800 permanent villages. theu800 size ofu800 au800 village village'su800 population depends onu800 theu800 amount ofu800 land available foru800 farming; thus villages canu800 range from asu800 fewu800 asu800 30u800 people tou800 asu800 many asu800 2000. asu800 with pastoral societies surplus food leads tou800 au800 more complex division ofu800 labor. specialized roles inu800 horticultural societies include craftspeople shamans religious leaders andu800 traders. this role specialization allows people tou800 create au800 wide variety ofu800
