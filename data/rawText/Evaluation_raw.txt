studies areu800 based onu800 anu800 objectivist_epistemology#epistemology _reason objectivist epistemology from anu800 elite perspective. clarify date mayu800 2012 although both ofu800 these approaches seek tou800 misrepresent value interpretations about anu800 object they function differently from each other. information obtained through politically controlled studies isu800 released oru800 withheld tou800 meet theu800 special interests ofu800 theu800 holder whereas public relations information creates au800 positive image ofu800 anu800 object regardless ofu800 theu800 actual situation. despite theu800 application ofu800 both studies inu800 reality real scenarios neither ofu800 these approaches isu800 acceptable evaluation practice. objectivist elite quasi-evaluation objectivist elite quasi-evaluation objectivist elite quasi-evaluation asu800 au800 group these five approaches represent au800 highly respected collection ofu800 disciplined inquiry approaches. they areu800 considered quasi-evaluation approaches because particular studies legitimately canu800 focus only onu800 questions ofu800 knowledge without addressing anyu800 questions ofu800 value. such studies areu800 byu800 definition notu800 evaluations. these approaches canu800 produce characterizations without producing appraisals although specific studies canu800 produce both. each ofu800 these approaches serves itsu800 intended purpose well. they areu800 discussed roughly inu800 order ofu800 theu800 extent tou800 which they approach theu800 objectivist ideal.   experiment experimental research   isu800 theu800 best approach foru800 determining causality causal relationships between variable math variables . theu800 potential problem with using this asu800 anu800 evaluation approach isu800 that itsu800 highly controlled andu800 stylized methodology mayu800 notu800 beu800 sufficiently responsive tou800 theu800 dynamically changing needs ofu800 most human service programs.   management information system systems  miss canu800 give detailed information about theu800 dynamic operations ofu800 complex programs. however this information isu800 restricted tou800 readily numerical data quantifiable data usually available atu800 regular intervals.   educational assessment testing programs  areu800 familiar tou800 just about anyone whou800 hasu800 attended school served

oru800 tou800 au800 setu800 ofu800 standards ofu800 performance. however they only focus onu800 testee performance andu800 they might notu800 adequately sample what isu800 taught oru800 expected.   project objective objectives -based  approaches relate outcomes tou800 prespecified objectives allowing judgments tou800 beu800 made about their level ofu800 attainment. unfortunately theu800 objectives areu800 often notu800 proven tou800 beu800 important oru800 they focus onu800 outcomes toou800 narrow tou800 provide theu800 basis foru800 determining theu800 value ofu800 anu800 object.   content analysis   isu800 au800 quasi-evaluation approach because content analysis judgments need notu800 beu800 based onu800 value statements. instead they canu800 beu800 based onu800 knowledge. such content analyses areu800 notu800 evaluations. onu800 theu800 other hand when content analysis judgments areu800 based onu800 values such studies areu800 evaluations. objectivist mass quasi-evaluation

accurate accounting ofu800 results that canu800 improve theu800 quality business quality ofu800 product project management products andu800 service economics services . however this approach quickly canu800 turn practitioners andu800 consumer consumers into adversaries when implemented inu800 au800 heavy-handed fashion.  objectivist elite true evaluation    decision making decision -oriented  studies areu800 designed tou800 provide au800 knowledge base foru800 making andu800 defending decisions. this approach usually requires theu800 close collaboration between anu800 evaluator andu800 decision-maker allowing itu800 tou800 beu800 susceptible tou800 political corruption corruption andu800 bias .   policy analysis policy studies   provide general guidance andu800 direction onu800

ofu800 effects. however this approach does notu800 necessarily help practitioners improve their work andu800 itu800 requires au800 very good andu800 credible evaluator tou800 dou800 itu800 well. subjectivist elite true evaluation subjectivist elite true evaluation subjectivist elite true evaluation   accreditation ofu800 certification body accreditation professional certification

qualified individuals whou800 useu800 established guidelines tou800 determine ifu800 theu800 applicant should beu800 approved tou800 perform specified functions. however unless performance-based
