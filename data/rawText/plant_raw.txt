robert whittaker proposed theu800 creation ofu800 theu800 kingdom fungi. molecular evidence hasu800 since shown that theu800 last common ancestor concestor ofu800 theu800 fungi wasu800 probably more

cells with cell wall walls composed ofu800 cellulose andu800 most obtain their energy through photosynthesis using light water andu800 carbon dioxide tou800 synthesize food. about three hundred plant species dou800 notu800 photosynthesize butu800 areu800 parasite parasites onu800 other species ofu800 photosynthetic plants. plants areu800 distinguished from green alga algae which represent au800 mode ofu800 photosynthetic life similar tou800 theu800 kind modern plants areu800 believed tou800 have evolved from byu800 having specialized reproductive organs protected byu800 nonu800-reproductive tissues. bryophytes first appeared during theu800 early paleozoic . they canu800 only survive where moisture isu800 available foru800 significant periods although some species areu800 desiccation-tolerant. most species ofu800 bryophytes remain small throughout their life-cycle. this involves anu800 alternation between twou800 generations au800 haploid stage called theu800 gametophyte andu800 au800 diploid stage called theu800 sporophyte . inu800 bryophytes theu800 sporophyte isu800 always unbranched andu800 remains nutritionally dependent onu800 itsu800 parent

spread into many different terrestrial environments. they developed au800 number ofu800 adaptations that allowed them tou800 spread into increasingly more arid places notably theu800 vascular tissues xylem andu800 phloem that transport water andu800 food throughout theu800 organism. root systems capable ofu800 obtaining soil water andu800 nutrients also evolved during theu800 devonian. inu800
