theu800 process byu800 which humans andu800 animals organize andu800 execute their actions. fundamentally itu800 isu800 theu800 integration ofu800 perception sensory information both about theu800

approached from au800 wide range ofu800 disciplines including psychology cognitive science biomechanics andu800 neuroscience . while theu800 modern study ofu800 motor control isu800 anu800

section date mayu800 2013 most movements that areu800 carried outu800 during dayu800 tou800 dayu800 activity areu800 formed using au800 continual process ofu800 accessing sensory information andu800 using itu800 tou800 more accurately continue theu800 motion. this type ofu800 motor control isu800 called feedback control asu800 itu800 relies onu800 sensory feedback tou800 control movements. feedback control isu800 au800 situated form ofu800 motor control relying onu800 sensory information about performance andu800 specific sensory input from theu800 environment inu800 which theu800 movement isu800 carried outu800. this sensory input while processed does notu800 necessarily cause conscious awareness ofu800 theu800 action.  closed loop control  isu800 au800 feedback based mechanism ofu800 motor control where anyu800 actu800 onu800 theu800 environment creates some sort ofu800 change that will affect future performance through feedback. closed loop motor control isu800 best suited tou800 continuously controlled actions butu800 does notu800 work quickly enough foru800 ballistic actions. ballistic actions areu800 actions that continue tou800 theu800 endu800 without

ofu800 many interacting parts atu800 many different organizational levels. peripheral neurons receive input from theu800 central nervous system andu800 enervate theu800 muscles. inu800 turn muscles generate forces which actuate joints. getting theu800 pieces tou800 work together isu800 au800 challenging problem foru800 theu800 motor system andu800 howu800 this problem isu800 resolved isu800 anu800 active area ofu800 study inu800 motor control research. reflexes reflexes reflexes inu800 some cases theu800 coordination ofu800 motor components isu800 hard-wired consisting ofu800 fixed neuromuscular pathways that areu800 called reflex  reflexes  . reflexes areu800 typically characterized asu800 automatic andu800 fixed motor responses andu800 they occur onu800 au800 much faster time scale than what isu800 possible foru800 reactions that depend onu800 perceptual processing. reflexes play au800 fundamental role inu800 stabilizing theu800 motor system providing almost immediate compensation foru800 small perturbations andu800 maintaining fixed execution patterns. some reflex loops areu800 routed solely through theu800 spinal cord without receiving input from theu800 brain andu800 thus dou800 notu800 require attention oru800 conscious control. others involve lower brain areas andu800 canu800 beu800 influenced byu800 prior instructions oru800 intentions butu800 they remain independent ofu800 perceptual processing andu800 online control. theu800 simplest reflex isu800 theu800   reflex_arc#monosynaptic_vsu82e_polysynaptic monosynaptic reflex   oru800 short-loop reflex such asu800 theu800 monosynaptic stretch response. inu800 this example iau800 afferent neurons areu800 activated byu800 muscle spindle muscle spindels when they deform dueu800 tou800 theu800 stretching ofu800 theu800 muscle. inu800 theu800 spinal cord these afferent neurons synapse directly onto alpha motor neurons that regulate theu800 contraction ofu800 theu800 same muscle. thus anyu800 stretching ofu800 au800 muscle automatically signals au800 reflexive contraction ofu800 that muscle without anyu800 central control. asu800 theu800 name andu800 theu800 description implies monosynaptic reflexes depend onu800 au800 single synaptic connection between anu800 afferent sensory neuron andu800 efferent motor neuron. inu800 general theu800 actions ofu800 monosynaptic reflexes areu800 fixed andu800 cannot beu800 controlled oru800 influenced byu800 intention oru800 instruction. however there isu800 some evidence tou800 suggest that theu800 gain oru800 magnitude ofu800 these reflexes canu800 beu800 adjusted byu800 context andu800 experience.  polysynaptic reflexes  oru800 long-loop reflexes areu800 reflex arcs which involve more than au800 single synaptic connection inu800 theu800 spinal cord. these loops mayu800 include cortical regions ofu800 theu800 brain asu800 well andu800 areu800 thus slower than their monosynaptic counterparts dueu800 tou800 theu800 greater travel time. however actions controlled byu800 polysynaptic reflex loops areu800 still faster than actions which require perceptual processing. rpu800 171u800 while theu800 actions ofu800 short-loop reflexes areu800 fixed polysynaptic reflexes canu800 often beu800 regulated byu800 instruction oru800 prior experience. au800 common example ofu800 au800 long loop reflex isu800 theu800 asymmetrical tonic neck reflex observed inu800 infants. synergies synergies synergies au800 motor   motor coordination#muscle synergies synergy   isu800 au800 collection ofu800 motor components whose activations covary tou800 produce some desired movement oru800 action. theu800 components ofu800 au800 synergy need notu800 beu800 physically connected butu800 instead areu800 connected byu800 their response tou800 perceptual information about theu800 particular motor task being executed. synergies areu800 learned rather than being hardwired like reflexes andu800 areu800 organized inu800 au800 task-dependent manner; au800 synergy isu800 structured foru800 au800 particular action andu800 notu800 determined generally foru800 theu800 components themselves. nikolai bernstein famously demonstrated synergies atu800 work inu800 theu800 hammering actions ofu800 professional blacksmiths. theu800 muscles ofu800 theu800 armu800 controlling theu800 movement ofu800 theu800 hammer areu800 informationally linked inu800 such au800 wayu800 that errors andu800 variability inu800 oneu800 muscle areu800 automatically compensated foru800 byu800 theu800 actions ofu800 theu800 other muscles. these compensatory actions areu800 reflex-like inu800 that they occur faster than perceptual processing would seem tou800 allow yetu800 they areu800 only present inu800 expert performance notu800 inu800 novices. inu800 theu800 case ofu800 blacksmiths theu800 synergy inu800 question isu800 organized specifically foru800 hammering actions andu800 isu800 notu800 au800 general purpose organization ofu800 theu800 muscles ofu800 theu800 armu800. synergies have twou800 defining characteristics inu800 addition tou800 being task dependent; sharing andu800 flexibility stability. sharing requires that theu800 execution ofu800 au800 particular motor task depends onu800 theu800 combined actions ofu800 allu800 theu800 components that make upu800 theu800 synergy. often there areu800 more components involved than areu800 strictly need foru800 theu800 particular task motor control#redundancy seeu800 redundancy below butu800 theu800 control ofu800 that motor task isu800 distributed across allu800 components nonetheless. au800 simple demonstration comes from au800 twou800-finger force production task where participants areu800 required tou800 generate au800 fixed amount ofu800 force byu800 pushing down onu800 twou800 force plates with twou800 different fingers. inu800 this task participants generated au800 particular force output byu800 combining theu800 contributions ofu800 independent fingers. while theu800 force produced byu800 anyu800 single finger canu800 vary this variation isu800 constrained byu800 theu800 action ofu800 theu800 other such that theu800 desired force isu800 always generated. cou800-variation also provides flexibility andu800 stability tou800 motor tasks. considering again theu800 force production task ifu800 oneu800 finger didu800 notu800 produce enough force itu800 could beu800 compensated foru800 byu800 theu800 other. theu800 components ofu800 au800 motor synergy areu800 expected tou800 change their action tou800 compensate foru800 theu800 errors andu800 variability inu800 other components that could affect theu800 outcome ofu800 theu800 motor task. this provides flexibility because itu800 allows foru800 multiple motor solutions tou800 particular tasks andu800 itu800 provides motor stability byu800 preventing errors inu800 individual motor components from affecting theu800 task itself. synergies simplify theu800 computational difficulty ofu800 motor control. coordinating theu800 numerous degrees ofu800 freedom mechanics degrees ofu800 freedom inu800 theu800 body isu800 au800 challenging problem both because ofu800 theu800 tremendous complexity ofu800 theu800 motor system asu800 well asu800 theu800 different levels atu800 which this organization canu800 occur neural muscular kinematic spatial etcu800. . because theu800 components ofu800 au800 synergy areu800 functionally coupled foru800 au800 specific task execution ofu800 motor tasks canu800 beu800 accomplished byu800 activating theu800 relevant synergy with au800 single neural signal. theu800 need tou800 control allu800 ofu800 theu800 relevant components independently isu800 removed because organization emerges automatically asu800 au800 consequence ofu800 theu800 systematic covariation ofu800 components. similar tou800 howu800 reflexes areu800 physically connected andu800 thus dou800 notu800 require control ofu800 individual components byu800 theu800 central nervous system actions canu800 beu800 executed through synergies with minimal executive control because they areu800 functionally connected. motor programs motor programs motor programs while synergies represent coordination derived from peripheral interactions ofu800 motor components   motor program programs  areu800 specific preu800-structured motor activation patterns that areu800 generated andu800 executed byu800 au800 central controller inu800 theu800 case ofu800 au800 biological organism theu800 brain . rpu800 227u800 they represent atu800 topu800-down approach tou800 motor coordination rather than theu800 bottom-upu800 approach offered byu800 synergies. motor programs areu800 executed inu800 anu800 open-loop manner although sensory information isu800 most likely used tou800 sense theu800 current state ofu800 theu800 organism andu800 determine theu800 appropriate goals. however once theu800 program hasu800 been executed itu800 cannot beu800 altered online byu800 additional sensory information. evidence foru800 theu800 existence ofu800 motor programs comes from studies ofu800 rapid movement execution andu800 theu800 difficulty associated with changing those movements once they have been initiated. foru800 example people whou800 areu800 asked tou800 make fast armu800 swings have extreme difficulty inu800 halting that movement when provided with au800 stop signal after theu800 movement hasu800 been initiated. interestingly this reversal difficulty persists even ifu800 theu800 stop signal isu800 presented after theu800 initial gou800 signal butu800  before  theu800 movement actually begins. this research suggests that once selection andu800 execution ofu800 au800 motor program begins itu800 must runu800 tou800 completion before another action canu800 beu800 taken. this effect hasu800 been found even when theu800 movement that isu800 being executed byu800 au800 particular motor program isu800 prevented from occurring atu800 allu800. people whou800 attempt tou800 execute particular movements such asu800 pushing with theu800 armu800 butu800 unknowingly have theu800 action ofu800 their body arrested before anyu800 movement canu800 actually take place show theu800 same muscle activation patterns including stabilizing andu800 support activation that does notu800 actually generate theu800 movement asu800 when they areu800 allowed tou800 complete their intended action. although theu800 evidence foru800 motor programs seems persuasive there have been several important criticisms ofu800 theu800 theory. theu800 first isu800 theu800 problem ofu800 storage. ifu800 each movement anu800 organism could generate requires itsu800 ownu800 motor program itu800 would seem necessary foru800 that organism tou800 possess anu800 unlimited repository ofu800 such programs andu800 where these would beu800 kept isu800 notu800 clear. aside from theu800 enormous memory requirements such au800 facility would take nou800 motor program storage area inu800 theu800 brain hasu800 yetu800 been identified. theu800 second problem isu800 concerned with novelty inu800 movement. ifu800 au800 specific motor program isu800 required foru800 anyu800 particular movement itu800 isu800 notu800 clear howu800 oneu800 would ever produce au800 novel movement. atu800 best anyu800 newu800 movement would have tou800 beu800 practiced extensively before itu800 could beu800 executed with anyu800 success andu800 atu800 worst nou800 newu800 movements would beu800 possible because nou800 motor program would ever exist. these difficulties have ledu800 tou800 au800 more nuanced notion ofu800 motor programs known asu800  generalized motor programs . rpu800 240u800-257u800 au800 generalized motor program isu800 au800 program foru800 au800 particular  class  ofu800 action rather than au800 specific movement. this program isu800 parameterized byu800 theu800 context ofu800 theu800 environment andu800 theu800 current state ofu800 theu800 organism. redundancy redundancy redundancy anu800 important issue foru800 coordinating theu800 motor system isu800 theu800 problem ofu800 theu800  redundancy  ofu800 motor degrees ofu800 freedom. asu800 detailed inu800 theu800 motor control#synergies synergies section many actions andu800 movements canu800 beu800 executed inu800 multiple ways because functional synergies controlling those actions areu800 able tou800 cou800-vary without changing theu800 outcome ofu800 theu800 action. this isu800 possible because there areu800 more motor components involved inu800 theu800 production ofu800 actions than areu800 generally required byu800 theu800 physical constraints onu800 that action. foru800 example theu800 human armu800 hasu800 seven joints which determine theu800 position ofu800 theu800 hand inu800 theu800 world. however only three spatial dimensions areu800 needed tou800 specify anyu800 location theu800 hand could beu800 placed inu800. this excess ofu800 kinematic degrees ofu800 freedom means that there areu800 multiple armu800 configurations that correspond tou800 anyu800 particular location ofu800 theu800 hand. some ofu800 theu800 earliest andu800 most influential work onu800 theu800 study ofu800 motor redundancy came from theu800 russian physiologist nikolai bernstein . bernstein bernstein'su800 research wasu800 primarily concerned with understanding howu800 coordination wasu800 developed foru800 skilled actions. heu800 observed that theu800 redundancy ofu800 theu800 motor system made itu800 possible tou800 execute actions andu800 movements inu800 au800 multitude ofu800 different ways while achieving equivalent outcomes. this equivalency inu800 motor action means that there isu800 nou800 oneu800-tou800-oneu800 correspondence between theu800 desired movements andu800 theu800 coordination ofu800 theu800 motor system needed tou800 execute those movements. anyu800 desired movement oru800 action does notu800 have au800 particular coordination ofu800 neurons muscles andu800 kinematics which will make itu800 possible butu800 instead this motor equivalency problem became known asu800 theu800   degrees ofu800 freedom problem   because itu800 isu800 au800 product ofu800 having redundant degrees ofu800 freedom available inu800 theu800 motor system. perception inu800 motor control perception inu800 motor control perception inu800 motor control related yetu800 distinct from theu800 issue ofu800 howu800 theu800  processing  ofu800 sensory information affects theu800 control ofu800 movements andu800 actions isu800 theu800 question ofu800 howu800 theu800 perception ofu800 theu800 world structures action. perception isu800 extremely important inu800 motor control because itu800 carries theu800 relevant information about objects environments andu800 bodies which isu800 used inu800 organizing andu800 executing actions andu800 movements. what isu800 perceived andu800 howu800 theu800 subsequent information isu800 used tou800 organize theu800 motor system isu800 au800 current andu800 ongoing area ofu800 research. model based control strategies model based control strategies model based control strategies most model based strategies ofu800 motor control rely onu800 perceptual information butu800 assume that this information isu800 notu800 always useful veridical oru800 constant. optical information isu800 interrupted byu800 eyeu800 blinks motion isu800 obstructed byu800 objects inu800 theu800 environment distortions canu800 change theu800 appearance ofu800 object shape. model based andu800 representational control strategies areu800 those that rely onu800 accurate internal models ofu800 theu800 environment constructed from au800 combination ofu800 perceptual information andu800 prior knowledge asu800 theu800 primary source information foru800 planning andu800 executing actions even inu800 theu800 absence ofu800 perceptual information. inference andu800 indirect perception inference andu800 indirect perception inference andu800 indirect perception many models ofu800 theu800 perceptual system assume indirect perception oru800 theu800 notion that theu800 world that gets perceived isu800 notu800 identical tou800 theu800 actual environment. environmental information must gou800 through several stages before being perceived andu800 theu800 transitions between these stages introduce ambiguity. what actually gets perceived isu800 theu800 mind mind'su800 best guess about what isu800 occurring inu800 theu800 environment based onu800 previous experience. support foru800 this idea comes from theu800 ames room illusion where au800 distorted room causes theu800 viewer tou800 seeu800 objects known tou800 beu800 au800 constant size asu800 growing oru800 shrinking asu800 they move around theu800 room. theu800 room itself isu800 seen asu800 being square oru800 atu800 least consisting ofu800 right angles asu800 allu800 previous rooms theu800 perceiver hasu800 encountered have hadu800 those properties. another example ofu800 this ambiguity comes from theu800 doctrine ofu800 specific nerve energies . theu800 doctrine presents theu800 finding that there areu800 distinct nerve types foru800 different types ofu800 sensory input andu800 these nerves will respond inu800 au800 characteristic wayu800 regardless ofu800 theu800 method ofu800 stimulation. that isu800 tou800 sayu800 theu800 color redu800 causes optical nerves tou800 fire inu800 au800 specific pattern that isu800 processed byu800 theu800 brain asu800 experiencing theu800 color redu800. however ifu800 that same nerve isu800 electrically stimulated inu800 anu800 identical pattern theu800 brain could perceive theu800 color redu800 when nou800 corresponding stimuli isu800 present. forward models forward models forward models   internal_model_ motor_control #forward_models forward models   areu800 au800 predictive internal model ofu800 motor control that takes theu800 available perceptual information combined with au800 particular motor program andu800 tries tou800 predict theu800 outcome ofu800 theu800 planned motor movement. forward models structure action byu800 determining howu800 theu800 forces velocities andu800 positions ofu800 motor components will affect changes inu800 theu800 environment andu800 inu800 theu800 individual. forward models areu800 thought tou800 take motor programs asu800 their input inu800 order tou800 predict theu800 outcome ofu800 anu800 action. anu800 error signal isu800 generated when theu800 predictions made byu800 au800 forward model dou800 notu800 match theu800 actual outcome ofu800 theu800 movement prompting anu800 update ofu800 anu800 existing model andu800 providing au800 mechanism foru800 learning. these models explain whyu800 itu800 isu800 impossible tou800 tickle yourself. au800 sensation isu800 experienced asu800 ticklish when itu800 isu800 unpredictable. however forward models predict theu800 outcome ofu800 your motor movements meaning theu800 motion isu800 predictable andu800 therefore notu800 ticklish. evidence foru800 forward models comes from studies ofu800 motor adaptation. when au800 person person'su800 goal-directed reaching movements areu800 perturbed byu800 au800 force field they gradually butu800 steadily adapt theu800 movement ofu800 their armu800 tou800 allow them tou800 again reach their goal. however they dou800 sou800 inu800 such au800 wayu800 that preserves some high level movement characteristics; bell-shaped velocity profiles straight line translation ofu800 theu800 hand andu800 smooth continuous movements. these movement features areu800 recovered despite theu800 fact that they require startlingly different armu800 dynamics iu800u82eeu800. torques andu800 forces . this recovery provides evidence that what isu800 motivating movement isu800 au800 particular motor plan andu800 theu800 individual isu800 using au800 forward model tou800 predict howu800 armu800 dynamics will change theu800 movement ofu800 theu800 armu800 tou800 achieve particular task level characteristics. differences between theu800 expected armu800 movement andu800 theu800 observed armu800 movement produces anu800 error signal which isu800 used asu800 theu800 basis foru800 learning. additional evidence foru800 forward models comes from experiments which require subjects tou800 determine theu800 location ofu800 anu800 effector following anu800 unvisualized movement inverse models inverse models inverse models   internal_model_ motor_control #inverse_models inverse models   predict theu800 necessary movements ofu800 motor components tou800 achieve au800 desired perceptual outcome. they canu800 also take theu800 outcome ofu800 au800 motion andu800 attempt tou800 determine theu800 sequence ofu800 motor commands that resulted inu800 that state. these types ofu800 models areu800 particularly useful foru800 open loop control andu800 allow foru800 specific types ofu800 movements such asu800 fixating onu800 au800 stationary object while theu800 head isu800 moving. complimentary tou800 forward models inverse models attempt tou800 estimate howu800 tou800 achieve au800 particular perceptual outcome inu800 order tou800 generate theu800 appropriate motor plan. because inverse models andu800 forward model areu800 sou800 closely associated studies ofu800 internal models areu800 often used asu800 evidence foru800 theu800 roles ofu800 both model types inu800 action. motor adaptation studies therefore also make au800 case foru800 theu800 existence ofu800 inverse models. motor movements seem tou800 follow predefined plans which preserve certain invariant features ofu800 theu800 movement. inu800 theu800 reaching task mentioned above theu800 persistance ofu800 bell-shaped velocity profiles andu800 smooth straight hand trajectories provides evidence foru800 theu800 existence ofu800 such plans. theu800 movements which achieve these desired task-level outcomes areu800 estimated byu800 anu800 inverse model. adaptation therefore proceeds asu800 au800 process ofu800 estimating theu800 necessary movements with anu800 inverse model simulating with au800 forward model theu800 outcome ofu800 those movement plans observing theu800 difference between theu800 desired outcome andu800 theu800 actual outcome andu800 updating theu800 models foru800 au800 future attempt. information based control information based control information based control anu800 alternative tou800 model based control isu800  information based control . informational control strategies organize movements andu800 actions based onu800 perceptual information about theu800 environment rather than onu800 cognitive models oru800 representations ofu800 theu800 world. theu800 actions ofu800 theu800 motor system areu800 organized byu800 information about theu800 environment andu800 information about theu800 current state ofu800 theu800 agent. information based control strategies often treat theu800 environment andu800 theu800 organism asu800 au800 single system with action proceeding asu800 au800 natural consequence ofu800 theu800 interactions ofu800 this system. au800 core assumption ofu800 information based control strategies isu800 that perceptions ofu800 theu800 environment areu800 rich inu800 information andu800 veridical foru800 theu800 purposes ofu800 producing actions. this runs counter tou800 theu800 assumptions ofu800 indirect perception made byu800 model based control strategies. direct perception direct perception direct perception  direct perception  inu800 theu800 cognitive sense isu800 related tou800 theu800 philosophical notion ofu800 nau8c3afve realism nau8c3afve oru800 direct realism inu800 that itu800 isu800 predicated onu800 theu800 assumption that what weu800 perceive isu800 what isu800 actually inu800 theu800 world. james ju800. gibson isu800 credited with recasting direct perception asu800   ecological psychology#gibson ecological perception  . while theu800 problem ofu800 indirect perception proposes that physical information about object inu800 ouru800 environment isu800 notu800 available dueu800 tou800 theu800 ambiguity ofu800 sensory information proponents ofu800 direct perception like gibson suggest that theu800 relevant information encoded inu800 sensory signals isu800 notu800 theu800 physical properties ofu800 objects butu800 rather theu800 action opportunities theu800 environment affords. these   affordance affordances  areu800 directly perceivable without ambiguity andu800 thus preclude theu800 need foru800 internal models oru800 representations ofu800 theu800 world. affordances exist only asu800 au800 byproduct ofu800 theu800 interactions between anu800 agent andu800 itsu800 environment andu800 thus perception isu800 anu800 ecological endeavor depending onu800 theu800 whole agent environment system rather than onu800 theu800 agent inu800 isolation. because affordances areu800 action possibilities perception isu800 directly connected tou800 theu800 production ofu800 actions andu800 movements. theu800 role ofu800 perception isu800 tou800 provide information that specifies howu800 actions should beu800 organized andu800 controlled andu800 theu800 motor system isu800 tuned tou800 respond tou800 specific type ofu800 information inu800 particular ways. through this relationship control ofu800 theu800 motor system andu800 theu800 execution ofu800 actions isu800 dictated byu800 theu800 information ofu800 theu800 environment. asu800 anu800 example au800 doorway affords passing through butu800 au800 wall does notu800. howu800 anu800 oneu800 might pass through au800 doorway isu800 specified byu800 theu800 visual information received from theu800 environment asu800 well asu800 theu800 information perceived about oneu800 oneu800'su800 ownu800 body. together this information determines theu800 pass-ability ofu800 au800 doorway butu800 notu800 au800 wall. inu800 addition theu800 actu800 ofu800 moving towards andu800 passing through theu800 doorway generates more information andu800 this inu800 turn specifies further action. theu800 conclusion ofu800 direct perception isu800 that actions andu800 perceptions areu800 critically linked andu800 oneu800 cannot beu800 fully understood without theu800 other. behavioral dynamics behavioral dynamics behavioral dynamics building onu800 theu800 assumptions ofu800 direct perception  behavioral dynamics  isu800 au800 behavioral control theory which treats perceptual organisms asu800 dynamic systems that respond tou800 informational variables

theu800 available information about theu800 environment which specified inu800 body-relevant variables. much ofu800 theu800 research inu800 behavioral dynamics hasu800 focused onu800 locomotion where

million muscles fibers which areu800 controlled byu800 around 1000 ofu800 motor nerves. within oneu800 motor units which canu800 categorized tou800 skeletal_muscle#muscle_fibers type iu800 slow twitch oru800 type iiu800 fibers fast twitch theu800 composition type ofu800 theu800 muscle fiber will beu800 consistent homogeneous ; whereas within oneu800 muscle there will beu800 several different combination ofu800 twou800 types ofu800 motor units heterogeneous . there areu800 three primary types ofu800 skeletal_muscle#muscle_fibers muscle fibers type iu800 type iiau800 andu800 type iibu800. asu800 described above type iu800 muscle fibers areu800 known asu800  slow twitch redox oxidative   type iiau800 areu800  fast twitch redox oxidative   andu800 type iibu800 areu800   fast twitch

anu800 athlete want tou800 move their body tou800 achieve au800 certain task theu800 brain then send outu800 anu800 instantaneously impulse signal that reach theu800 specific motor unit through theu800 spinal cord . after receiving theu800 signal from theu800 brain theu800 motor unit contract muscle fibers within theu800 group foru800 movement ofu800 theu800 body. there areu800 nou800

motor unites areu800 known asu800  lowu800 threshold motor units . inu800 theu800 lowu800 threshold motor units they consist ofu800 type iu800 fibers that contract much slower andu800 thus provide

threshold motor units . theu800 major difference between au800 lowu800 threshold motor units oru800 slow twitch motor unit andu800 au800 high threshold motor units oru800 fast twitch motor unit isu800 that theu800 motor unit with high threshold controls more muscle fiber oru800 these cells fibers areu800 larger inu800 compare tou800 theu800 lowu800 threshold motor unit. onu800 theu800 other hand theu800 main difference between theu800 slow twitch muscle fiber type iu800 andu800 fast twitch muscle fiber type iiu800 hasu800 theu800 same theory ofu800 theu800 size deviations.   theu800 order

tou800 control them. fast twitch motor units areu800 controlled byu800 fast twitch nerves while slow twitch motor units areu800 controlled byu800 slow twitch nerves. inu800 theu800 laboratory au800 nerve from au800 motor unit that isu800 connected tou800 au800 slow twitch muscle fiber wasu800 replace with au800 nerve that areu800 designate foru800 au800 fast twitch fiber. amazingly theu800 slow

however theu800 nerves canu800 notu800 possibly transform from fast motor nerves into slow motor nerves andu800 vice versa. inu800 many sports movements theu800 duration ofu800 certain action usually

reach peak power production. this brings outu800 au800 question ofu800 what isu800 theu800 superiority ofu800 having more type iiu800 fibers this canu800 beu800 documented when youu800 analyze au800 large group ofu800 athletes foru800 vertical jump performance andu800 their execution foru800 au800 vertical jump. athletes with more fast-twitch fibers type iiu800 change direction quicker during their movement such asu800 left tou800 right direction andu800 they tend tou800 useu800 less knee bend. these results canu800 beu800 confirmed byu800 muscle biopsy andu800 even byu800 special force-plate analysis. this does notu800 mean that athletes with lower fast-twitch fiber cannot jump higher butu800 they tend tou800 dou800 itu800 au800 little slower andu800 with au800 deeper knee bend. although having au800 high percentage ofu800 type iiu800 fibers give au800 person more quicker movement there isu800 little doubt that theu800 nervous system andu800 theu800 brain isu800 more important onu800 affecting theu800 performance.   muscle recruitment motor unit recruitment   theu800 majority ofu800 theu800 time theu800 real limit tou800 athletes performance isu800 theu800 number ofu800 motor units their nervous system canu800 recruit inu800 theu800 short period ofu800 time andu800 theu800 amount ofu800 forces size ofu800 theu800 muscle fibers provided ofu800 those motor units. theu800 performance isu800 rarely affect byu800 theu800 type ofu800 muscle fiber slow twitch oru800 fast that constructed tou800 motor units. theu800 nervous system determines theu800 degree

tou800 contract same length ofu800 time demonstrating maximum strength oru800 force. however vertical jump activity only takes 0u800u82e2u800 seconds tou800 perform. therefore theu800 factor ofu800 determining theu800 performance isu800 within 0u800u82e2u800 seconds howu800 many available muscle motor units canu800 beu800 recruited foru800 contraction yetu800 howu800 much fast twitch fibers
