straight hair thus curly oru800 coiled hair would beu800 particularly advantageous foru800 light-skinned hominids living atu800 theu800 equator . itu800 isu800 substantiated byu800 iyengar iyengar'su800 1998 findings that uvu800 light canu800 enter into straight human hair roots andu800 thus into theu800 body through theu800 skin viau800 theu800 hair shaft. specifically theu800 results ofu800 that study suggest that this phenomenon resembles theu800 passage ofu800 light through fiber optic tubes which dou800 notu800 function asu800 effectively when kinked oru800 sharply curved oru800 coiled . inu800 this sense when hominids iu800u82eeu800. homo erectus were gradually losing their straight body hair andu800 thereby exposing theu800 initially pale skin underneath their furu800 tou800 theu800 sunu800 straight hair would have been anu800 adaptive liability. byu800 inverse logic later asu800 humans traveled farther from africa andu800 oru800 theu800 equator straight hair mayu800 have initially evolved tou800 aidu800 theu800 entry ofu800 uvu800 light into theu800 body during theu800 transition from dark uvu800-protected skin tou800 paler skin. some conversely believe that tightly coiled hair that grows into au800 typical afro-like formation would have greatly reduced theu800 ability ofu800 theu800 head andu800 brain tou800 cool because although african peoples isu800 much less dense than itsu800 european counterpart inu800 theu800 intense sunu800 theu800 effective 'woolly hatu800' that such hair produced would have been au800 disadvantage. however such anthropologists asu800 nina jablonski oppositely argue about this hair texture. specifically jablonski jablonski'su800 assertions suggest that theu800 adjective woolly inu800 reference tou800 afro-hair isu800 au800 misnomer inu800 connoting theu800 high heat insulation derivable from theu800 true wool ofu800 sheep. instead theu800 relatively sparse density ofu800 afro-hair combined with itsu800 springy coils actually results inu800 anu800 airy almost sponge-like structure that inu800 turn jablonski argues more likely facilitates anu800 increase inu800 theu800 circulation ofu800 cool airu800 onto theu800 scalp. further wetu800 afro-hair does notu800 stick tou800 theu800 neck andu800 scalp unless totally drenched andu800 instead tends tou800 retain itsu800 basic springy puffiness because itu800 less easily responds tou800 moisture andu800 sweat than straight hair does. inu800 this sense theu800 trait mayu800 enhance comfort levels inu800 intense equatorial climates more than straight hair which onu800 theu800 other hand tends tou800 naturally fall over theu800 ears andu800 neck tou800 au800 degree that provides slightly enhanced comfort levels inu800 cold climates relative tou800 tightly coiled hair . further some interpret theu800 ideas ofu800 charles darwin asu800 suggesting that some traits such asu800 hair texture were sou800 arbitrary tou800 human survival that theu800 role natural selection played wasu800 trivial. hence they argue inu800 favor ofu800 hisu800 suggestion that sexual selection mayu800 beu800 responsible foru800 such traits. descent ofu800 manu800 however inclinations towards deeming hair texture adaptively trivial mayu800 root inu800 certain cultural value judgments more than objective logic. inu800 this sense theu800 possibility that hair  texture  mayu800 have played anu800 adaptively significant role cannot beu800 completely eliminated from consideration. inu800 fact while theu800 sexual selection hypothesis cannot beu800 ruled outu800 theu800 asymmetrical distribution ofu800 this trait vouches foru800 environmental influence. specifically ifu800 hair texture were simply theu800 result ofu800 adaptively arbitrary human aesthetic preferences oneu800 would expect that theu800 global distribution ofu800 theu800 various hair textures would beu800 fairly random. dubious date september 2010 instead theu800 distribution ofu800 afro-hair isu800 strongly skewed toward theu800 equator. further itu800 isu800 notable that theu800 most pervasive expression ofu800 this hair texture canu800 beu800 found inu800 subu800-saharan africa; au800 region ofu800 theu800 world that abundant genetic andu800 paleo-anthropological evidence suggests wasu800 theu800 relatively recent 200u800 000u800 year oldu800 point

this they suggest that only light reflected from theu800 ground could successfully enter theu800 hair follicle andu800 beu800 transmitted down theu800 shaft. even this process they argue isu800 hindered byu800 theu800 curvature atu800 theu800 base ofu800 theu800 hair. therefore coupled with theu800 amount ofu800 skin covered byu800 long head hair these factors seem tou800 militate against theu800 adaptive usefulness ofu800 straight hair atu800 northern latitudes. they further argue whou800 date february 2013 that uvu800 light also isu800 poorly reflected from soil andu800 dull

ability tou800 grow long hair onu800 theu800 crown ofu800 theu800 head asu800 well asu800 theu800 face provides au800 distinct advantage inu800 au800 cold climate. since theu800 main sensory organs
