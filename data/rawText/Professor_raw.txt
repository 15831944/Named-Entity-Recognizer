summary ofu800 theu800 candidate candidate'su800 previous research butu800 should beu800 ofu800 significant scientific cultural oru800 social value. another requirement isu800 tou800 have au800 large

applicant should have au800 good record ofu800 scientific publications andu800 other academic achievements. theu800 learned council ofu800 theu800 institute where theu800 applicant foru800 such au800 professor title works upon hisu800 heru800 primary application tou800 this council votes andu800 decides whether tou800 recommend oru800 notu800 tou800 recommend tou800 apply onu800 behalf ofu800

u8e2809cassistantu8e2809d assists tou800 theu800 professor oru800 lecturer helps inu800 performing exercises oru800 sometimes also gives lectures under theu800 supervision ofu800 theu800 professor. u8e2809cassistantu8e2809d however isu800 notu800 permitted tou800 hold au800 chair oru800 tou800 examine students alone. theu800 level ofu800 theu800 u8e2809cassistantu8e2809d does notu800 require

inu800 theu800 english-speaking areas. unlike u8e2809cassistantu8e2809d u8e2809cdocentu8e2809d isu800 permitted tou800 give lectures independently tou800 beu800 examiner supervisor ofu800 paper works

andu800 u8e2809cassistantu8e2809d areu800 chair-related. ifu800 this isu800 theu800 case u8e2809cdocentu8e2809d usually hasu800 some kind ofu800 dependence upon theu800 professor butu800 still possesses much independence unlike theu800 u8e2809cassistantu8e2809d. after four oru800 five years oru800 more exceptions areu800 rare andu800 au800 significant scientific record

university level spain university level spain university level refimprove section date mayu800 2009 selection procedures selection procedures selection procedures inu800 theu800 past twenty-five years spain hasu800 gone through three university reforms 1983 leyu800 deu800 reforma universitaria lruu800 2001 leyu800 orgu8c3a1nica deu800 universidades louu800 andu800 2007 au800 mere reform ofu800 theu800 louu800 with several specific modifications ofu800 theu800 2001 actu800 . weu800 canu800 name them lruu800 1983 louu800 2001 andu800 louu800 2007. theu800 actual categories ofu800 tenured andu800 untenured positions andu800 theu800 basic department andu800 university organization were established byu800 lruu800 1983 andu800 only specific details have been reformed byu800 louu800 2001 andu800 louu800 2007. theu800 most important reform these later acts introduced isu800 theu800 wayu800 candidates tou800 au800 position areu800 selected. according tou800 lruu800 1983 au800 committee ofu800 five members hadu800 tou800 evaluate theu800 curricula ofu800 theu800 candidates. au800 newu800 committee wasu800 constituted foru800 each newu800 position operating inu800 theu800 same university offering that position. these committees hadu800 twou800 members appointed byu800 theu800 department including theu800 secretary ofu800 theu800 committee andu800 three members whou800 were draw-selected from anyu800 university butu800 belonging tou800 theu800 same knowledge area . theu800 louu800 2001 andu800 louu800 2007 acts have granted even more freedom tou800 universities when choosing applicants foru800 au800 position. each university nowu800 freely establishes theu800 rules foru800 theu800 creation ofu800 anu800 internal committee that assigns available positions. however theu800 last reform also have introduced anu800 external quality control process. tou800 better understand these reforms itu800 isu800 worth examining theu800 situation both before andu800 after 2007. theu800 situation before 2007 wasu800 this louu800 2001 hadu800 established au800 procedure based onu800 competition atu800 national level tou800 became au800 civil servant. this procedure andu800 theu800 license au800 candidate obtained wasu800 called habilitaciu8c3b3n andu800 itu800 included curricula evaluation andu800 personal examinations. theu800 external committee wasu800 formed byu800 seven draw-selected members belonging tou800 theu800 same knowledge area andu800 fulfilling requisites related tou800 research curricula whou800 could assign au800 fixed andu800 preu800-determined number ofu800 habilitaciones similar tou800 theu800 positions requested byu800 theu800 universities. anu800 applicant tou800 au800 particular position inu800 anyu800 university hadu800 tou800 beu800 habilitado licensed byu800 this national committee inu800 order tou800 apply. nonu800 civil servants hadu800 au800 slightly different quality control process. au800 specific institution called theu800 spanish agency foru800 evaluation quality andu800 certification oru800 aneca byu800 itsu800 spanish acronym illu800 esu800 agencia nacional deu800 evaluaciu8c3b3n deu800 lau800 calidad yu800 acreditaciu8c3b3n examined theu800 applicants curricula andu800 issued them au800 positive evaluation called acreditaciu8c3b3n certification giving access tou800 theu800 exams tou800 became au800 tenured-civil servant professor. today following theu800 louu800 2007 reform theu800 whole process hasu800 been simplified andu800 both civil andu800 nonu800 civil servants need tou800 achieve au800 positive evaluation ofu800 their teaching andu800 research record byu800 aneca. once theu800 certification byu800 aneca isu800 achieved candidates canu800 apply foru800 theu800 exams convened byu800 each university tou800 fulfill their vacant positions. theu800 certification system introduced byu800 theu800 louu800 2001 actu800 andu800 particularly theu800 2007 reform which requires theu800 candidate tou800 pass au800 demanding evaluation process atu800 au800 national level foru800 each category before applying foru800 au800 position hasu800 increased theu800 standards ofu800 spanish university professors tou800 those ofu800 most oecd countries. theu800 louu800 actu800 ofu800 2001 maintained both traditional tenured andu800 civil servant positions ofu800 profesor titular andu800

master'su800 have found itu800 impossible tou800 convert their degree since theu800 duration ofu800 their bachelor bachelor'su800 wasu800 three years while theu800 spanish bachelor bachelor'su800 degree holders cannot gou800 directly foru800 au800 phdu800 being asu800 itu800 isu800 necessary tou800 hold au800  licenciatura  which would beu800 theu800 roughly equivalent tou800 au800 master

beu800 awarded au800 bachelor bachelor'su800 degree  diplomado  andu800 will have tou800 study until finishing theu800 full master master'su800 degree which lasts from four tou800 sixu800 years four

foru800 people studying technical oru800 scientific subjects such asu800 engineering physics medicine etcu800. andu800 theu800 main reason ofu800 this isu800 that getting au800 phdu800 inu800 these cases only takes about three years with au800 course structure very similar tou800 those ofu800 theu800 english-speaking world; inu800 other areas such asu800 lawu800 history oru800 economics phdu800
