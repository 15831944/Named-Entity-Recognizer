sonu800 richard onu800 them. development development development harry chamberlin chamberlin'su800 idea foru800 inventing theu800 instrument came from hisu800 recording himself playing anu800 organ. heu800 formed theu800 idea ofu800 playback music coming from anu800 organ asu800 au800 source ofu800 entertainment. heu800 soon setu800 about designing theu800 first chamberlin instruments asu800 early asu800 1949. theu800 intention wasu800 foru800 theu800 instrument tou800 function asu800 au800 home entertainment device foru800 family sing-alongs playing theu800 bigu800 band standards ofu800 theu800 dayu800. theu800 chamberlin chamberlin'su800 useu800 asu800 au800 commercial instrument inu800 rock oru800 rock andu800 roll music wasu800 never given consideration asu800 harry chamberlin generally resented rock music andu800 rock musicians. theu800 basic chamberlin hasu800 au800 piano -style keyboard. underneath each keyu800 isu800 anu800 individual magnetic tape tape playing mechanism. each tape isu800 preu800-recorded with various musical instrument instruments oru800 special effect effects. when theu800 player presses down au800 keyu800 au800 pressure padu800 pushes theu800 tape onu800 tou800 au800 tape head andu800 au800 pinch roller beneath theu800 keyu800 catches theu800 tape andu800 pulls itu800 forward into storage boxu800 oru800 onu800 tou800 au800 roller mechanism . asu800 this occurs theu800 sound ofu800 theu800 tape isu800 heard through anu800 amplified speaker. when theu800 player releases theu800 keyu800 theu800 sound stops andu800 theu800 tape rewinds byu800 either metal spring rods asu800 onu800 theu800 early chamberlins oru800 byu800 au800 return roller mechanism asu800 onu800 theu800 later m1u800 models . each tape isu800 only au800

recordings were undertaken. allu800 chamberlin recordings were contracted andu800 performed byu800 members ofu800 theu800 lawrence welk orchestra inu800 theu800 late 1940s andu800 throughout theu800 1950s. welk wasu800 impressed with theu800 idea ofu800 au800 tape playback instrument andu800 offered tou800 fund itsu800 manufacture ifu800 itu800 wasu800 called au800 welk machine. chamberlin refused welk welk'su800 offer. chamberlin used uu800 47u800 neumann uu800 47u800 microphones tou800 record theu800 sounds. theu800 sounds areu800 characterized byu800 au800 very clean output andu800 heavy vibrato which wasu800 customary ofu800 theu800 music styles ofu800 theu800 time. theu800 chamberlin sounds have little audio level compression compression andu800 possess dynamics true tou800 theu800 instruments recorded onu800 theu800 tapes such asu800 theu800 airu800 inu800 theu800 flute oru800 theu800 flow inu800 ofu800 theu800 strings . theu800 chamberlin instruments were designed tou800 accurately replicate theu800 sound ofu800 theu800 instrument recorded onu800 theu800 tape. they were also meant tou800 beu800 physically setu800 inu800 oneu800 place andu800 notu800 moved around. because ofu800 this there wasu800 less attention paid tou800 making theu800 instrument robust andu800 many early chamberlins have nou800 internal chassis andu800 areu800 prone tou800 gou800 outu800 ofu800 adjustment. asu800 chamberlin refined theu800 build ofu800 hisu800 instruments heu800 began tou800 bring them tou800 music trade shows andu800 competitors such asu800 hammond organ hammond andu800 lowrey organ lowrey were often curious about theu800 origin ofu800 chamberlin sounds. inu800 anu800 effort tou800 compete these companies were forced tou800 create drum rhythms andu800 manufacture plastic tabs with orchestral instrument names onu800 them. these tabs would generate tones that simulated theu800 sound ofu800 theu800 instrument selected. theu800 american federation ofu800 musicians also took notice asu800 well andu800 tried tou800 limit live performances ofu800 chamberlin instruments fearing that their members would beu800 putu800 outu800 ofu800 work. despite theu800 controversy musicians worldwide embraced theu800 chamberlin andu800 mack theu800 knife singer bobby darin wasu800 oneu800 ofu800 theu800 first customers buying au800 customized model 300u800

tou800 become hisu800 salesman. franson travelled theu800 country offering theu800 chamberlin instruments tou800 music stores parlours andu800 cocktail lounges. offers ofu800 larger distribution were made butu800 harry chamberlin preferred word ofu800 mouth advertising andu800 didu800 notu800 like theu800 terms andu800 conditions ofu800 distributorship andu800 eschewed itu800. chamberlin also preferred andu800 favoured doing business with lounges nightclubs andu800 musicians whou800 embraced bigu800 band music andu800 disliked having hisu800 instrument associated with rock andu800 roll music oru800 rock musicians. inu800 1962 bill franson hadu800 gone missing foru800 several months. au800 radio could beu800 heard playing music inu800 hisu800 apartment butu800 attempts tou800 contact himu800 proved futile. franson hadu800 left foru800 england byu800 boat taking twou800 chamberlin 600u800 models with himu800 oneu800 ofu800 these eventually became theu800 possession ofu800 todd

playback heads. bradmatic ltdu800. anu800 engineering company responded tou800 theu800 adu800. franson removed theu800 chamberlin labels andu800 sold theu800 nowu800 reu800-badged franson instrument tou800 them without harry chamberlin chamberlin'su800 knowledge. refining theu800 600u800 design into theu800 mellotron mark 1u800 bradmatic eventually became streetly electronics andu800 began manufacture ofu800 theu800 mellotron mark 2u800 inu800 1963. inu800 1965 harry chamberlin became aware ofu800 this after being contacted byu800 mellotron distributors inu800 america andu800 forced au800 legal arrangement with streetly electronics. after visiting owners frank norman andu800 lesu800 bradley inu800 person andu800 having anu800 intense discussion with franson anu800 arrangement wasu800 made where mellotrons would only beu800 sold inu800 theu800 uku800 andu800 chamberlins would beu800 sold inu800 theu800 usau800. chamberlin would also receive royalties royalty payment payments from theu800 mellotron company though this apparently ended inu800 theu800 late 1960s. through this same royalty system harry also allowed theu800 chamberlin 3u800 violins sound tou800 beu800 used asu800 theu800 violins sound inu800 theu800 mellotron library. this violin sound became theu800 mellotron mellotron'su800 main sound used onu800 much ofu800 theu800 output ofu800 british mellotron music beginning inu800 theu800 midu800-1960s. consequently itu800 canu800 beu800 difficult tou800 tell whether au800 recording features au800 mellotron oru800 chamberlin when theu800 3u800 violins tapes areu800 used other than byu800 theu800 country ofu800 origin ofu800 theu800 recording. mistaking chamberlin sounds foru800 real instruments isu800 common with ofu800 allu800 chamberlin sounds because ofu800 theu800 wayu800 they were recorded nou800 processing andu800 because there were fewer mixdown master tapes made compared tou800 theu800 mellotron library. theu800 mu800 series chamberlins also have greater bandwidth playback heads which enhances this quality further. itu800 isu800 important tou800 note that chamberlin instruments were never distributed foru800 sale outside
