hypervisor products lines vmware vmware'su800 type 1u800 hypervisors running directly onu800 hardware along with their hosted type 2u800 hypervisors. vmware software provides au800 completely platform

accessdate 2009-07u800-01u800 vmware software virtualizes theu800 hardware foru800 au800 video adapter au800 network adapter andu800 hard disk adapters. theu800 host provides pass-through drivers foru800 guest usbu800 serial andu800 parallel devices. inu800 this wayu800 vmware virtual machines become highly portable between computers because every host looks nearly identical tou800 theu800 guest. inu800 practice au800 system administrator canu800 pause operations onu800 au800 virtual machine guest move oru800 copy that guest tou800 another physical computer andu800 there resume execution exactly atu800 theu800 point ofu800 suspension. alternatively foru800 enterprise servers au800 feature called vmotion allows theu800 migration ofu800 operational guest virtual machines between similar butu800 separate hardware hosts sharing theu800 same storage oru800 with vmotion storage separate storage canu800 beu800 used toou800 . each ofu800 these transitions isu800 completely transparent tou800 anyu800 users onu800 theu800 virtual machine atu800 theu800 time itu800 isu800 being migrated. vmware workstation server andu800 esxu800 take au800 more optimized path tou800 running target operating systems onu800 theu800 host than emulator emulators such asu800 bochs which simulate theu800 function ofu800 each cpuu800 instruction onu800 theu800 target machine oneu800-byu800-oneu800 oru800 dynamic recompilation which compiles blocks ofu800 machine-instructions theu800 first time they execute andu800 then uses theu800 translated code directly when theu800 code runs subsequently microsoft virtual pcu800 foru800 macu800 osu800 xu800 takes this approach. vmware software does notu800 emulate anu800 instruction setu800 foru800 different hardware notu800 physically present. this significantly boosts performance butu800 canu800 cause problems when moving virtual machine guests between hardware hosts using different instruction-sets such asu800 found inu800 64u800-bitu800 intel andu800 amdu800 cpus oru800 between hardware hosts with au800 differing number ofu800 cpus. software that isu800 cpuu800 agnostic canu800 usually survive such au800 transition unless itu800 isu800 agnostic byu800 forking atu800 startup inu800 which case theu800 software oru800 theu800 guest osu800 must beu800 stopped before moving itu800 then restarted after theu800 move. vmware vmware'su800 products predate theu800 x86u800 virtualization#hardware assist virtualization extensions tou800 theu800 x86u800 instruction setu800 andu800 dou800 notu800 require virtualization-enabled processors. onu800 newer processors theu800 hypervisor isu800 nowu800 designed tou800 take advantage ofu800 theu800 extensions. however unlike many other hypervisors vmware still supports older processors. inu800 such cases itu800 uses theu800 cpuu800 tou800 runu800 code directly whenever possible asu800 foru800 example when running user space user-mode andu800 virtual 8086 mode code onu800 x86u800 . when direct execution cannot operate such asu800 with kernel-level andu800 real mode real-mode code vmware products useu800 binary translation btu800 tou800 reu800-write theu800 code dynamically. theu800 translated code gets stored inu800 spare memory typically atu800 theu800 endu800 ofu800 theu800 address space which segmentation memory segmentation mechanisms canu800 protect andu800 make invisible. foru800 these reasons vmware operates dramatically faster than emulators running atu800 more than 80u800 ofu800 theu800 speed that theu800 virtual guest operating-system would runu800 directly onu800 theu800 same hardware. inu800 oneu800 study vmware claims au800 slowdown over native ranging from 0u8e280936 percent foru800 theu800 vmware esxu800 server. cite webu800 title au800 performance comparison ofu800 hypervisors urlu800 vmware vmware'su800 approach avoids some ofu800 theu800 difficulties ofu800 virtualization onu800 x86u800-based platforms. virtual machines mayu800 deal with offending instructions byu800 replacing them oru800 byu800 simply running kernel-code inu800 user-mode. replacing instructions runs theu800 risk that theu800 code mayu800 fail tou800 find theu800 expected content ifu800 itu800 reads itself; oneu800 cannot protect code against reading while allowing normal execution andu800 replacing inu800-place becomes complicated. running theu800 code unmodified inu800 user-mode will also fail asu800 most instructions which just read theu800 machine-state dou800 notu800 cause anu800 exception andu800 will betray theu800 real state ofu800 theu800 program andu800 certain instructions silently change behavior inu800 user-mode. oneu800 must always rewrite; performing au800 simulation ofu800 theu800 current program counter inu800 theu800 original location when necessary andu800 notably remapping hardware code breakpoint breakpoints. although vmware virtual machines runu800 inu800 user-mode vmware workstation itself requires theu800 installation ofu800 various device driver driver drivers inu800 theu800 host operating-system notably tou800 dynamically switch theu800 global descriptor table
