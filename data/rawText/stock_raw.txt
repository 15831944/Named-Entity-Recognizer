theu800 efficient market hypothesis emhu800 continues tou800 beu800 popular although this theory isu800 widely discredited inu800 academic andu800 professional circles. briefly emhu800 says that investing isu800 overall weighted byu800 theu800 standard deviation rational; that theu800 price ofu800 au800 stock atu800 anyu800 given moment represents au800 rational evaluation ofu800 theu800

least au800 small premium onu800 expected value theu800 return onu800 equity canu800 beu800 expected tou800 beu800 slightly greater than that available from nonu800-equity investments ifu800 notu800

themselves inu800 theu800 flow ofu800 fundamental information seeking tou800 gain anu800 advantage over their competitors mainly other professional investors byu800 more intelligently interpreting theu800 emerging flow ofu800 information news . theu800 emhu800 model does notu800 seem tou800 give au800 complete description ofu800 theu800 process ofu800 equity price determination. foru800 example stock markets areu800 more volatile than emhu800 would imply. inu800 recent years itu800 hasu800 come tou800 beu800 accepted that theu800 share markets areu800 notu800 perfectly efficient perhaps especially inu800 emerging markets oru800 other markets that areu800 notu800 dominated byu800 well-informed professional investors. another theory ofu800 share price determination comes from theu800 field ofu800 behavioral finance . according tou800 behavioral finance humans often make irrational decisionsu8e28094particularly related tou800 theu800 buying andu800 selling ofu800 securitiesu8e28094based upon fears andu800 misperceptions ofu800 outcomes. theu800 irrational trading ofu800 securities canu800 often create securities prices which vary from rational fundamental price valuations. foru800 instance during theu800 technology bubble ofu800 theu800 late 1990s which wasu800 followed byu800 theu800 dotu800-comu800 bust ofu800 2000u8e280932002 technology companies were often bidu800 beyond anyu800 rational fundamental value because ofu800 what isu800 commonly known asu800 theu800 greater fool theory . theu800 greater fool theory holds that because theu800 predominant method ofu800 realizing returns inu800 equity isu800 from theu800 sale tou800 another investor oneu800 should select securities that they believe that someone else will value atu800 au800
