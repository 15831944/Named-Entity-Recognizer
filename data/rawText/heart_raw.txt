deu800-oxygenated bloodstream destined foru800 theu800 lungs andu800 theu800 oxygenated stream that isu800 delivered tou800 theu800 rest ofu800 theu800 body. theu800 absence ofu800 such au800 division

theu800 human heart called theu800   sinoatrial node sinoatrial sau800 node   oru800 pacemaker sets theu800 rate andu800 timing atu800 which allu800 cardiac muscle cells contract. theu800 sau800 node generates electrical impulses much like those produced byu800 nerve cells. because cardiac muscle cells areu800 electrically coupled byu800 inter-calculated disks between adjacent cells impulses from theu800 sau800 node spread rapidly through theu800 walls ofu800 theu800 artria causing both artria tou800 contract inu800 unison. theu800 impulses also pass tou800 another region ofu800 specialized cardiac muscle tissue au800 relay point called theu800   atrioventricular node   located inu800 theu800 wall between theu800 right atrium andu800 theu800 right ventricle. here theu800 impulses areu800 delayed foru800 about 0u800u82e1su800 before spreading tou800 theu800 walls ofu800 theu800 ventricle. theu800 delay ensures that theu800 artria empty completely before theu800 ventricles contract. specialized muscle fibers called purkinje fibers then conduct theu800 signals tou800 theu800 apex ofu800 theu800 heart along andu800 throughout theu800 ventricular walls. theu800 purkinje fibres form conducting pathways called bundle branches. this entire cycle au800 single heart beat lasts about 0u800u82e8u800 seconds. theu800 impulses generated during theu800 heart cycle produce electrical currents which areu800 conducted through body fluids tou800 theu800 skin where they canu800 beu800 detected byu800 electrodes andu800 recorded asu800 anu800 electrocardiography electrocardiogram

dissection arteries areu800 typically empty ofu800 blood because blood pools inu800 theu800 veins after death. ancient anatomists subsequently assumed they were filled with airu800 andu800 served tou800 transport itu800 around theu800 body. philosophers distinguished veins from arteries butu800 thought theu800 pulse wasu800 au800 property ofu800 arteries themselves. erasistratos observed that arteries cutu800 during life bleed. heu800 ascribed theu800 fact tou800 theu800 phenomenon that airu800 escaping from anu800 artery isu800 replaced with blood which entered byu800 very small vessels between veins andu800 arteries. thus heu800 apparently postulated capillary capillaries butu800 with reversed flow ofu800 blood. theu800 greek physician galen 2ndu800 century adu800 knew blood vessels carried blood andu800 identified venous dark redu800 andu800 arterial brighter andu800 thinner blood each with distinct andu800 separate functions. growth andu800 energy were derived from venous blood created inu800 theu800 liver from chyle while arterial blood gave vitality byu800 containing pneuma airu800 andu800 originated inu800 theu800 heart. blood flowed from both creating organs tou800

theu800 heart heart'su800 motion sucked blood inu800 during diastole andu800 theu800 blood moved byu800 theu800 pulsation ofu800 theu800 arteries themselves. galen believed theu800 arterial blood
