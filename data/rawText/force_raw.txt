certain assumptions ofu800 aristotelian physics were contradicted byu800 observations andu800 logic . galileo realized that galilean relativity simple velocity addition demands that theu800 concept ofu800 anu800 absolute rest frame didu800 notu800 exist. galileo concluded that motion inu800 au800 constant velocity wasu800 completely equivalent tou800 rest. this wasu800 contrary tou800 aristotle aristotle'su800 notion ofu800 au800 natural state ofu800 rest that objects with mass naturally approached. simple experiments showed that galileo galileo'su800 understanding ofu800 theu800 equivalence ofu800 constant velocity andu800 rest were correct. foru800 example ifu800 au800 mariner dropped au800 cannonball from theu800 crow crow'su800 nest ofu800 au800 ship moving atu800 au800 constant

ofu800 dynamic equilibrium occurs inu800 constant velocity motion across au800 surface with kinetic friction . inu800 such au800 situation au800 force isu800 applied inu800 theu800 direction ofu800

continues tou800 move with au800 nonu800-zero velocity. aristotle misinterpreted this motion asu800 being caused byu800 theu800 applied force. however when kinetic friction isu800 taken into
