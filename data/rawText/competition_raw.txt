would give consumers greater selection andu800 better products. theu800 greater selection typically causes lower prices foru800 theu800 products compared tou800 what theu800 price would beu800 ifu800

inu800 some circumstances. foru800 example theu800 intense competition foru800 theu800 small number ofu800 superstar celebrity topu800 jobs inu800 music andu800 movie acting leads many aspiring

economic competition have been classified theu800 most narrow form isu800  direct competition  also called category competition oru800 brand competition where product business products which perform theu800 same function compete against each other. foru800 example oneu800 brand ofu800 pick-upu800 trucks competes with several other brands ofu800 pick-upu800 trucks. sometimes twou800 companies areu800 rivals andu800 oneu800 adds newu800 products tou800 their line which leads tou800 theu800 other company distributing theu800 same newu800 things andu800 inu800 this manner they compete. theu800 next form isu800  substitute  oru800  indirect competition  where products which areu800 close substitutes foru800 oneu800 another compete. foru800 example butter competes with margarine mayonnaise andu800 other various sauces andu800 spreads. theu800 broadest form ofu800 competition isu800 typically called  budget competition . included inu800 this category isu800 anything onu800 which theu800 consumer might want tou800 spend their available income money . foru800 example au800 family which hasu800 20u800 000u800 available mayu800 choose tou800 spend itu800 onu800 many different items which canu800 allu800 beu800 seen asu800 competing with each other foru800 theu800 family family'su800 expenditure. this form ofu800 competition isu800 also sometimes described asu800 au800 competition ofu800 share ofu800 wallet . inu800 addition companies also compete foru800 financing onu800 theu800 capital markets equity oru800 debt inu800 order tou800 generate theu800 necessary cash foru800 their operations. anu800 investor typically will consider alternative investment opportunities given hisu800 risk profile andu800 notu800 only look atu800 companies just competing onu800 product  direct competitors  . enlarging theu800 investment universe tou800 include  indirect competitors  leads tou800 au800 broader peer universe ofu800 comparable indirectly competing companies. competition does notu800 necessarily have tou800 beu800 between companies. foru800 example business writers sometimes refer tou800  internal competition . this isu800 competition within companies. theu800 idea wasu800 first introduced byu800 alfred sloan atu800 general motors corporation general motors inu800 theu800 1920s. sloan deliberately created areas ofu800 overlap between divisions ofu800 theu800 company sou800 that each division would beu800 competing with theu800 other divisions. foru800 example theu800 chevy division would compete with theu800 pontiac division foru800 some market segment segments. theu800 competing brands byu800 theu800 same company allowed parts tou800 beu800 designed byu800 oneu800 division andu800 shared byu800 several divisions foru800 example parts designed byu800 chevy would also beu800 used byu800 pontiac. also inu800 1931 procter & gamble initiated au800 deliberate system ofu800 internal brand-versus-brand rivalry. theu800 company wasu800 organized around different brand brands with each brand allocated resources including au800 dedicated group ofu800 employees willing tou800 champion theu800 brand. each brand manager wasu800 given responsibility foru800 theu800 success oru800 failure ofu800 theu800 brand andu800 compensated accordingly. this isu800 known asu800  intra-brand competition . finally most businesses also encourage competition between individual employees. anu800 example ofu800 this isu800 au800 contest between sales representatives. theu800 sales representative with theu800 highest sales oru800 theu800 best improvement inu800 sales over au800 period ofu800 time would gain benefits from theu800 employer. shalev andu800 asbjornsen also found that success iu800u82eeu800. theu800 saving resulted ofu800 reverse auction auctions correlated most closely with competition. theu800 literature widely supported theu800 importance ofu800 competition asu800 theu800 primary driver ofu800 reverse auctions success. papersu82essrnu82ecomu800 their findings appear tou800 support that argument asu800 competition correlated strongly with theu800 reverse auction success asu800 well asu800 with theu800 number

often limited oru800 restricted. competition often isu800 subject tou800 legal restrictions. foru800 example competition mayu800 beu800 legally prohibited asu800 inu800 theu800 case with au800 government monopoly oru800 au800 government-granted monopoly . tariffs subsidies oru800 other protectionist measures mayu800 also beu800 instituted byu800 government inu800 order tou800 prevent oru800 reduce competition. depending onu800 theu800 respective economic policy pure competition isu800 tou800 au800 greater oru800 lesser extent regulated byu800 competition policy andu800 competition lawu800 . another component ofu800 these activities isu800 theu800 discovery process with instances ofu800 higher government regulation regulations typically leading tou800 less competitive businesses
