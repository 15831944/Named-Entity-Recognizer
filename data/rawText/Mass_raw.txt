apple behaves asu800 ifu800 au800 single powerful gravitational field were accelerating itu800 towards theu800 earthu8e28099s center. newtonu8e28099s concept ofu800 universal gravitational mass puts gravitational mass onu800 anu800 equal footing with theu800 traditional concepts ofu800 weight andu800 amount. foru800 example theu800 ancient romans hadu800 used theu800 carob seed asu800 au800 weight standard. theu800 romans could place anu800 object with anu800 unknown weight onu800 oneu800 side ofu800 au800 balance scale andu800 place carob seeds onu800 theu800 other side ofu800 theu800 scale increasing theu800 number ofu800 seeds until theu800 scale wasu800 balanced. ifu800 anu800 objectu8e28099s weight wasu800 equivalent tou800 1728 carob seeds then theu800 object wasu800 said tou800 weigh oneu800 roman pound. according tou800 newtonu8e28099s theory ofu800 universal gravitation each carob seed produces gravitational fields. therefore ifu800 oneu800 were tou800 gather anu800 immense number ofu800 carob seeds andu800 form them into anu800 enormous sphere then theu800 gravitational field ofu800 theu800 sphere would beu800 proportional tou800 theu800 number ofu800 carob

field similar tou800 that ofu800 theu800 earth oru800 sunu800. andu800 since theu800 roman weight units were allu800 defined inu800 terms ofu800 carob seeds then knowing theu800 earthu8e28099s oru800 sunu800 sunu800'su800 u8e2809ccarob seed massu8e2809d would allow oneu800 tou800 calculate theu800 mass inu800 roman pounds oru800 roman ounces oru800 anyu800 other roman unit. file cavendish

tou800 that ofu800 theu800 earth then this would allow oneu800 tou800 calculate theu800 earthu8e28099s mass inu800 avoirdupois pounds. also theu800 original kilogram wasu800 defined tou800 beu800 equal inu800 mass tou800 au800 liter ofu800 pure water theu800 modern kilogram isu800 defined byu800 theu800 manu800-made international prototype kilogram . thus theu800 mass ofu800 theu800 earth inu800 kilograms could theoretically beu800 determined byu800 ascertaining howu800 many liters ofu800 pure water oru800 international prototype kilograms would beu800 required tou800 produce

beu800 used tou800 measure gravitational mass. measuring gravitational mass inu800 terms ofu800 traditional mass units isu800 simple inu800 principle butu800 extremely difficult inu800 practice.

ifu800 oneu800 were tou800 collect anu800 immense number ofu800 objects theu800 resulting sphere would probably beu800 toou800 large tou800 construct onu800 theu800 surface ofu800 theu800 earth

weu800 might sayu800 that theu800 larger mass exerts au800 greater resistance tou800 changing itsu800 state ofu800 motion inu800 response tou800 theu800 force. however this notion ofu800 applying identical forces tou800 different objects brings usu800 back tou800 theu800 fact that weu800 have notu800 really defined what au800 force isu800. weu800 canu800 sidestep this difficulty with theu800 help ofu800 newton newton'su800 third lawu800 which states that ifu800 oneu800 object exerts au800 force onu800 au800 second object itu800 will experience anu800 equal andu800 opposite force. tou800 beu800 precise suppose weu800 have twou800 objects xu800 andu800 yu800 with constant inertial masses  mu800  xu800 andu800  mu800  yu800 . weu800 isolate theu800 twou800 objects from allu800 other physical influences sou800 that theu800 only forces present areu800 theu800 force exerted onu800 xu800 byu800 yu800 which weu800 denote  fu800  xyu800 andu800 theu800 force exerted onu800 yu800 byu800 xu800 which weu800 denote  fu800  yxu800 . newton newton'su800 second lawu800 states that begin align boldsymbol f_u800 xyu800 & m_xu800 boldsymbol a_xu800 boldsymbol f_u800 yxu800 & m_yu800 boldsymbol a_yu800 endu800 align where  au800  xu800 andu800  au800  yu800 areu800 theu800 accelerations ofu800 xu800 andu800 yu800 respectively. suppose that these accelerations areu800 nonu800-zero sou800 that theu800 forces between theu800 twou800 objects areu800 nonu800-zero. this occurs foru800 example ifu800 theu800 twou800 objects areu800 inu800 theu800 process ofu800 colliding with oneu800 another. newton newton'su800 third lawu800 then states that boldsymbol f_u800 xyu800 - boldsymbol f_u800 yxu800 ; andu800 thus frac m_xu800 m_yu800 - frac boldsymbol a_yu800 boldsymbol a_xu800 . note that ouru800 requirement that  au800  xu800 beu800 nonu800-zero ensures that theu800 fraction isu800 well-defined. this isu800 inu800 principle howu800 weu800 would measure theu800 inertial mass ofu800 anu800 object. weu800 choose au800 reference object andu800 define itsu800 mass  mu800  yu800 asu800 sayu800 1u800&nbsp;kilogram. then weu800 canu800 measure theu800 mass ofu800 anyu800 other object inu800 theu800 universe byu800 colliding itu800 with theu800 reference object andu800 measuring theu800 accelerations. newtonian gravitational mass newtonian gravitational mass newtonian

usu800 suppose weu800 have twou800 objects au800 andu800 bu800 separated byu800 au800 distance  ru800 abu800  . theu800 lawu800 ofu800 gravitation states that ifu800 au800 andu800 bu800 have gravitational masses  mu800  au800 andu800  mu800  bu800 respectively then each object exerts au800 gravitational force onu800 theu800 other ofu800 magnitude boldsymbol f_u800 abu800 -gm_am_b frac

measures weight. equivalence ofu800 inertial andu800 gravitational masses equivalence ofu800 inertial andu800 gravitational masses equivalence ofu800 inertial andu800 gravitational masses theu800 equivalence ofu800 inertial andu800 gravitational masses isu800 sometimes referred tou800 asu800 theu800 galilean equivalence principle oru800 theu800 weak equivalence principle . theu800 most important consequence ofu800 this equivalence principle applies tou800 freely falling objects. suppose weu800 have anu800 object with inertial andu800 gravitational masses  mu800  andu800  mu800  respectively. ifu800 theu800 only force acting onu800 theu800 object comes from au800 gravitational field  gu800  combining newton newton'su800 second lawu800 andu800 theu800 gravitational lawu800 yields theu800 acceleration boldsymbol au800 frac mu800 mu800 boldsymbol gu800 . this says that theu800 ratio ofu800 gravitational tou800 inertial mass ofu800 anyu800 object isu800 equal tou800 some constant  ku800  ifu800 andu800 only ifu800 allu800 objects fall atu800 theu800 same rate inu800 au800 given gravitational field. this phenomenon isu800 referred tou800 asu800 theu800 universality

universality ofu800 free-fall were conducted byu800 galileo galilei galileo . itu800 isu800 commonly stated that galileo obtained hisu800 results byu800 dropping objects from theu800 leaning tower

free-fall only applies tou800 systems inu800 which gravity isu800 theu800 only acting force. allu800 other forces especially friction andu800 airu800 resistance must beu800 absent oru800 atu800 least

theu800 ground; theu800 feather isu800 notu800 really inu800  free -fall because theu800 force ofu800 airu800 resistance upwards against theu800 feather isu800 comparable tou800 theu800 downward force

heart ofu800 theu800 general relativity general theory ofu800 relativity . einstein einstein'su800 equivalence principle states that within sufficiently small regions ofu800 space-time itu800 isu800 impossible tou800 distinguish between au800 uniform acceleration andu800 au800 uniform gravitational field. thus theu800 theory postulates that theu800 force acting onu800 au800 massive object caused

relativity mass andu800 energy inu800 special relativity main mass inu800 special relativity theu800 term  mass  inu800 special relativity usually refers tou800 theu800 rest mass ofu800 theu800 object which isu800 theu800 newtonian mass asu800 measured byu800 anu800 observer moving along with theu800 object. theu800   invariant mass   isu800 another name foru800 theu800  rest mass  ofu800 single particles. however theu800 more general invariant mass calculated with au800 more complicated formula mayu800 also beu800 applied tou800 systems ofu800 particles inu800 relative motion andu800 because ofu800 this isu800 usually reserved foru800 systems which consist ofu800 widely separated high-energy particles. theu800 invariant mass ofu800 systems isu800 theu800 same foru800 allu800 observers andu800 inertial frames andu800 cannot beu800 destroyed andu800 isu800 thus conserved sou800 long asu800 theu800 system isu800 closed. inu800 this case closure implies that anu800 idealized boundary

anyu800 given observer theu800 mass ofu800 anyu800 system isu800 separately conserved andu800 cannot change over time just asu800 energy isu800 separately conserved andu800 cannot change over time. theu800 incorrect popular idea that mass mayu800 beu800 converted tou800 massless energy inu800 relativity isu800 because some matter particles mayu800 inu800 some cases beu800 converted tou800 types ofu800 energy which areu800 notu800 matter such asu800 light kinetic energy andu800 theu800 potential energy inu800 magnetic electric andu800 other fields . however this confuses matter au800 nonu800-conserved andu800 illu800-defined thing with mass which isu800 well-defined andu800 isu800 conserved . even ifu800 notu800 considered matter allu800 types ofu800 energy still continue tou800 exhibit  mass  inu800 relativity citation needed date july 2013 . thus mass andu800 energy dou800 notu800 change into oneu800 another inu800 relativity; rather both areu800 names foru800 theu800 same thing andu800 neither mass noru800 energy  appear  without theu800 other. matter particles mayu800 notu800 beu800 conserved inu800 reactions inu800 relativity butu800 closed-system mass always isu800. foru800 example au800 nuclear bomb inu800 anu800 idealized super-strong boxu800 sitting onu800 au800 scale would inu800 theory show nou800 change inu800 mass when detonated although theu800 inside ofu800 theu800 boxu800 would become much hotter . inu800 such au800 system theu800 mass ofu800 theu800 boxu800 would change only ifu800 energy were allowed tou800 escape from theu800 boxu800 asu800 light oru800 heat. however inu800 that case theu800 removed energy would take itsu800 associated mass with itu800. letting heat outu800 ofu800 such au800 system isu800 simply au800 wayu800 tou800
