theu800 lawu800 ofu800 conservation ofu800 energy states that energy canu800 neither beu800 created noru800 destroyed butu800 itu800 canu800 beu800 changed into different forms. theu800 sumu800 ofu800

importance isu800 theu800 number ofu800 different forms that energy canu800 take. twou800 major categories ofu800 energy areu800  kinetic  andu800  potential . kinetic energy isu800 energy ofu800

field theory field such asu800 au800 gravitational field gravitational electric field electric oru800 magnetic field . foru800 example lifting anu800 object against gravity stores gravitational potential energy inu800 itu800 which isu800 converted tou800 kinetic energy ifu800 itu800 falls. specific forms ofu800 energy include theu800 radiant energy ofu800 electromagnetic wave waves such asu800 light elastic energy dueu800 tou800 theu800 stretching oru800 deformation ofu800 solid objects chemical energy such asu800 isu800 released when au800 fuel burns andu800 thermal energy theu800

status; asu800 theu800 most disordered highest entropy form ofu800 energy theu800 second lawu800 ofu800 thermodynamics limits theu800 amount ofu800 thermal energy that canu800 beu800 converted into other forms ofu800 energy. anyu800 object that hasu800 mass when stationary thus called rest mass mass-energy equivalence equivalently hasu800 rest mass#rest energy rest energy asu800 canu800 beu800 calculated using albert einstein 'su800 equation  eu800   mcu800  2u800 . rest energy being au800 form ofu800 energy canu800 beu800 changed tou800 oru800 from  other forms  ofu800 energy. asu800 with anyu800 energy transformation theu800 total amount ofu800 energy does notu800 increase oru800 decrease inu800 such au800 process. from this perspective theu800 amount ofu800 matter inu800 theu800 universe contributes tou800 itsu800 total energy. similarly  allu800  energy manifests asu800 anu800 equivalent amount ofu800 mass. foru800 example adding 25u800 kilowatt-hours 90u800 megajoules ofu800  anyu800 form  ofu800 energy tou800 anu800 object increases itsu800 mass byu800 1u800 microgram. ifu800 youu800 hadu800 au800 sensitive enough mass balance oru800 weighing scale scale this mass increase could beu800 measured. ouru800 sunu800 oru800 au800 nuclear bomb converts nuclear potential energy tou800 other forms ofu800 energy; itsu800 total mass doesn'tu800 decrease dueu800 tou800 that inu800 itself because itu800 still contains theu800 same total energy inu800 different forms butu800 itsu800 mass does decrease when theu800 energy escapes outu800 tou800 itsu800 surroundings largely asu800 radiant energy . additional exotic forms ofu800 energy permeate allu800 space including otherwise empty space. foru800 example allu800 space contains au800 small random energy density called theu800 zero point energy . energy isu800 necessary foru800 things tou800 change. allu800 living things require available energy tou800 stay alive; humans getu800 such energy from food along

larger transformations areu800 notu800 permitted because itu800 isu800 statistically unlikely that energy oru800 matter will randomly move into more concentrated forms oru800 smaller spaces. energy transformations inu800 theu800 universe over time areu800 characterized byu800 various kinds ofu800 potential energy that hasu800 been available since theu800 bigu800 bang later being released transformed tou800 more active types ofu800 energy such asu800 kinetic oru800 radiant energy when au800 triggering mechanism isu800 available. familiar examples ofu800 such processes include nuclear

theu800 core ofu800 theu800 earth releases heat. this thermal energy drives plate tectonics andu800 mayu800 lift mountains viau800 orogenesis . this slow lifting represents au800 kind ofu800 gravitational potential energy storage ofu800 theu800 thermal energy which mayu800 beu800 later released tou800 active kinetic energy inu800 landslides after au800 triggering event. earthquakes also release stored elastic potential energy inu800 rocks au800 store that hasu800 been produced ultimately from theu800 same radioactive heat sources. thus according tou800 present understanding familiar

these atoms. inu800 another similar chain ofu800 transformations beginning atu800 theu800 dawn ofu800 theu800 universe nuclear fusion ofu800 hydrogen inu800 theu800 sunu800 also releases another store ofu800 potential energy which wasu800 created atu800 theu800 time ofu800 theu800 bigu800 bang . atu800 that time according tou800 theory space expanded andu800 theu800 universe cooled toou800 rapidly foru800 hydrogen tou800 completely fuse into heavier elements. this meant that hydrogen represents au800 store ofu800 potential energy that canu800 beu800 released byu800 nuclear fusion fusion . such au800 fusion process isu800 triggered byu800 heat andu800 pressure generated from gravitational collapse ofu800 hydrogen clouds when they produce stars andu800 some ofu800 theu800 fusion energy isu800

occurs when large unstable areas ofu800 warm ocean heated over months give upu800 some ofu800 their thermal energy suddenly tou800 power au800 fewu800 days ofu800 violent airu800 movement. sunlight isu800 also captured byu800 plants asu800  chemical potential energy  inu800 photosynthesis when carbon dioxide andu800 water twou800 lowu800-energy compounds areu800 converted into theu800 high-energy compounds carbohydrates lipids andu800 proteins. plants also release oxygen during photosynthesis which isu800 utilized byu800 living organisms asu800 anu800 electron acceptor tou800 release theu800 energy ofu800 carbohydrates lipids andu800 proteins. release ofu800 theu800 energy stored during photosynthesis asu800 heat oru800 light mayu800 beu800 triggered suddenly byu800 au800
