formal software methodologies. theu800 task ofu800 developing large computer software software systems presents au800 significant intellectual challenge. producing software with anu800 acceptably high reliability within au800 predictable schedule andu800 budget hasu800 historically been difficult; theu800 academic andu800 professional discipline ofu800 software engineering concentrates specifically onu800 this challenge. components components components main central processing unit microprocessor au800 general purpose computer hasu800 four main components theu800 arithmetic logic unit aluu800 theu800 control unit theu800 computer data storage memory andu800 theu800 input andu800 output devices collectively termed iu800 ou800 . these parts areu800 interconnected byu800 busu800 computing buses often made ofu800 groups ofu800 wire wires. inside each ofu800 these parts areu800 thousands tou800 trillions ofu800 small electrical network electrical circuits which canu800 beu800 turned offu800 oru800 onu800 byu800 means ofu800 anu800 transistor electronic switch . each circuit represents au800 bitu800 binary digit ofu800 information sou800 that when theu800 circuit isu800 onu800 itu800 represents au800 u8e2809c1u8e2809d andu800 when offu800 itu800 represents au800 u8e2809c0u8e2809d inu800 positive logic representation . theu800 circuits areu800 arranged inu800 logic gate

basic iu800 ou800 andu800 often other hardware closely linked with these areu800 collectively known asu800 au800 central processing unit cpuu800 . early cpus were composed ofu800 many separate components butu800 since theu800 midu800-1970s cpus have typically been constructed onu800 au800 single integrated circuit called au800   microprocessor  . control unit control unit control unit main

theu800 control unit often called au800 control system oru800 central controller manages theu800 computer computer'su800 various components; itu800 reads andu800 interprets decodes theu800 program instructions transforming them into au800 series ofu800 control signals which activate other parts ofu800 theu800 computer. theu800 control unit unit'su800 role inu800 interpreting instructions hasu800 varied somewhat inu800 theu800 past. although theu800 control unit isu800 solely responsible foru800 instruction interpretation inu800 most modern computers this isu800 notu800 always theu800 case. many computers include some instructions that mayu800 only beu800 partially interpreted byu800 theu800 control system andu800 partially interpreted byu800 another device. this isu800 especially theu800 case with specialized computing hardware that mayu800 beu800 partially self-contained. foru800 example edvac oneu800 ofu800 theu800 earliest stored-program computers used au800 central control unit that only interpreted four instructions. allu800 ofu800 theu800 arithmetic-related instructions were passed onu800 tou800 itsu800 arithmetic unit andu800 further decoded there. control systems inu800 advanced computers mayu800 change theu800 order ofu800 some instructions sou800 asu800 tou800 improve performance. au800 keyu800 component common tou800 allu800 cpus isu800 theu800 program counter au800 special memory cell au800 processor register register that keeps track ofu800 which location inu800 memory theu800 next instruction isu800 tou800 beu800 read from. instructions often occupy more than oneu800 memory address therefore theu800 program counter usually increases byu800 theu800 number ofu800 memory locations required tou800 store oneu800 instruction. theu800 control system system'su800 function isu800 asu800 followsu8e28094note that this isu800 au800 simplified description andu800 some ofu800 these steps mayu800 beu800 performed concurrently oru800 inu800 au800 different order depending onu800 theu800 type ofu800 cpuu800 # read theu800 code foru800 theu800 next instruction from theu800 cell indicated byu800 theu800 program counter. # decode theu800 numerical code foru800 theu800 instruction into au800 setu800 ofu800 commands oru800 signals foru800 each ofu800 theu800 other systems. # increment theu800 program counter sou800 itu800 points tou800 theu800 next instruction. # read whatever data theu800 instruction requires from cells inu800 memory oru800 perhaps from anu800 input device . theu800 location ofu800 this required data isu800 typically stored within theu800 instruction code. # provide theu800 necessary data tou800 anu800 aluu800 oru800 register. # ifu800 theu800 instruction requires anu800 aluu800 oru800 specialized hardware tou800 complete instruct theu800 hardware tou800 perform theu800 requested operation. # write theu800 result from theu800 aluu800 back tou800 au800 memory location oru800 tou800 au800 register oru800 perhaps anu800 output device. # jump back tou800 step 1u800 . since theu800 program counter isu800 conceptually just another setu800 ofu800 memory cells itu800 canu800 beu800 changed byu800 calculations done inu800 theu800 aluu800. adding 100u800 tou800 theu800 program counter would cause theu800 next instruction tou800 beu800 read from au800 place 100u800 locations further down theu800 program. instructions that modify theu800 program counter areu800 often known asu800 u8e2809cjumpsu8e2809d andu800 allow foru800 loops instructions that areu800 repeated byu800 theu800 computer andu800 often

wasu800 theu800 computer memory ofu800 choice throughout theu800 1960s until itu800 wasu800 replaced byu800 semiconductor memory. au800 computer computer'su800 memory canu800 beu800 viewed asu800

specialized applications oru800 historical contexts. au800 computer canu800 store anyu800 kind ofu800 information inu800 memory ifu800 itu800 canu800 beu800 represented numerically. modern computers have billions oru800 even trillions ofu800 bytes ofu800 memory. theu800 cpuu800 contains au800 special setu800 ofu800 memory cells called processor register registers that canu800 beu800 read andu800 written tou800 much more rapidly than theu800 main memory area. there areu800 typically between twou800 andu800 oneu800 hundred registers depending onu800 theu800 type ofu800 cpuu800. registers areu800 used foru800 theu800 most frequently needed data items tou800 avoid having tou800 access main memory every time data isu800 needed. asu800 data isu800 constantly being worked onu800 reducing theu800 need tou800 access main memory which isu800 often slow compared tou800 theu800 aluu800 andu800 control units greatly increases theu800 computer computer'su800 speed. computer main memory comes inu800 twou800 principal varieties random-access memory oru800 ramu800 andu800 read-only memory oru800 romu800. ramu800 canu800 beu800 read andu800 written tou800 anytime theu800 cpuu800 commands itu800 butu800 romu800 isu800 preloaded with data andu800 software that never changes therefore theu800 cpuu800 canu800 only read from itu800. romu800 isu800 typically used tou800 store theu800

romu800 retains itsu800 data indefinitely. inu800 au800 pcu800 theu800 romu800 contains au800 specialized program called theu800 bios that orchestrates loading theu800 computer computer'su800
