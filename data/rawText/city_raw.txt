tou800 assert what conditions gave rise tou800 theu800 first cities. some theorists however have speculated onu800 what they consider suitable preu800-conditions andu800 basic mechanisms that might have been important driving forces. theu800 conventional view holds that cities first formed after theu800 neolithic revolution . theu800 neolithic revolution brought agriculture which made denser human populations possible thereby supporting city development. harv bairoch 1988 ppu800 3u8e280934 theu800 advent ofu800 farming encouraged hunter-gatherers tou800 abandon nomadic lifestyles andu800 tou800 settle near others whou800 lived byu800 agricultural production. theu800 increased population-density encouraged byu800 farming andu800 theu800 increased output ofu800 food peru800 unit ofu800 land created conditions that seem more suitable foru800 city-like activities. inu800 hisu800 book  cities andu800 economic development  paul bairoch takes upu800 this position inu800 hisu800 argument that agricultural activity appears necessary before true cities canu800 form. according tou800 vere gordon childe foru800 au800 settlement tou800 qualify asu800 au800 city itu800 must have enough surplus ofu800 rawu800 materials tou800 support trade andu800 au800 relatively large population. harv pacione 2001 pu800 16u800 bairoch points outu800 that dueu800 tou800 sparse population densities that would have persisted inu800 preu800-neolithic hunter-gatherer societies theu800 amount ofu800 land that would beu800 required tou800 produce enough food foru800 subsistence andu800 trade foru800 au800 large population would make itu800 impossible tou800 control theu800 flow ofu800 trade. tou800 illustrate this point bairoch offers anu800 example western europe during theu800 preu800-neolithic where theu800 density must have been less than 0u800u82e1u800 person peru800 square kilometer . harv bairoch 1988 pu800 13u800 using this population density asu800 au800 base foru800 calculation andu800 allotting 10u800 ofu800 food towards surplus foru800 trade andu800 assuming that city dwellers dou800 nou800 farming heu800 calculates that ...tou800 maintain au800 city with au800 population

transportation isu800 taken into account theu800 figure rises tou800 200u800 000u800 square kilometers&nbsp;... . bairoch noted that this isu800 roughly theu800 size ofu800 great britain . theu800 urban theorist jane jacobs suggests that city-formation preceded theu800 birth ofu800 agriculture butu800 this view isu800 notu800 widely accepted. harv jacobs 1969 pu800 23u800 inu800 hisu800 book  city economics  brendan ou800'flaherty asserts cities could persistu8e28094as they have foru800 thousands ofu800 yearsu8e28094only ifu800 their advantages offset theu800 disadvantages harv ou800'flaherty 2005 pu800 12u800 . ou800'flaherty illustrates twou800 similar attracting advantages known asu800 increasing returns tou800 scale andu800 economies ofu800 scale which areu800 concepts normally associated with firm firms. their applications areu800 seen inu800 more basic economic systems asu800 well. increasing returns tou800 scale occurs when doubling allu800 inputs more than doubles theu800 output andu800 anu800 activity hasu800 economies ofu800 scale ifu800 doubling output less than doubles cost harv ou800'flaherty 2005 ppu800 572u8e28093573 . tou800 offer anu800 example

advantage isu800 expressed asu800 harv ou800'flaherty 2005 pu800 13u800 1u800   ou800 su800 2u800   where ou800 isu800 theu800 output area protected andu800 su800 stands foru800 theu800 length ofu800

areu800 increasing returns tou800 scale 3u800   ou800 iu800 2u800 16u800  . this equation solving foru800   su800   inu800 1u800 andu800 substituting inu800 2u800 shows that with twice theu800 inputs youu800 produce quadruple theu800 output. also economies ofu800 scale 4u800   iu800 4ou800 1u800 2u800  . this equation solving foru800   iu800   inu800 equation 3u800 shows that theu800 same output

tenu800-percent increase inu800 earnings. glaeser furthers hisu800 argument byu800 stating that bigger cities dou800 notu800 payu800 more foru800 equal productivity than inu800 au800 smaller city
